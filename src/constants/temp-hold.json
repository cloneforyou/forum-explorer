Please don&#x27;t be complacent, it&#x27;s very important to do something about this.<p>At risk of repeating my comment[0] from 3 days ago, I&#x27;d like to appeal to you to contact the MEPs that will vote on Wednesday in the EU&#x27;s JURI committee. This was the first time I called politicians&#x27; offices to voice my opinion. The assistants were shocked that a private person actually bothered to do so and seemed quite humbled - I could hear the change in the tone of their voice when they realised an ordinary citizen is calling. I think it&#x27;s a lot more effective than the 1000s of e-mails piling up in their spam folders.<p>Please help out to make sure this directive proposal is voted against on Wednesday by the majority of the JURI committee.

    "text": "Let me first say that this law is taking too far. There is a need for better legislation around copyright, but this one is just moving the needle from platforms abusing copyright to rights holders abusing the platforms.<p>However the situation around YouTube is not a direct consequence of poor technology, but rather poor policies. YouTube built 2 separate products, a) Content ID (CID), b) partnership program.<p>CID is the system that, based on fingerprinting algorithms, is able to identify videos containing same segments (both audio and visual). Technically it&#x27;s actually pretty good. However through the partnership program, YouTube allows rights holders to abuse the system by providing reference files that they may not have direct rights for, or allow them to claim any content just because they say so.<p>This however has nothing to do with the technology itself, but rather with YouTube&#x27;s decision to not to have to challenge right holders directly (they can and will sue, while users uploading content will most probably not).<p>There are ways to deal with this kind of situation, but most of the platforms, especially YouTube and Facebook are somehow not interested.",

And if the content creators are on YT, that is where the users are. Moreover, users have curated lists of subscriptions and creators have large lists of material. Finally, YT has access to a lot of data on viewing behavior, and likes. This means YT should be a lot better at recommending videos to users.<p>Finally, the creators that most want to switch to an alternative are those who are the most censored. These tend to be more controversial, which means these alternative services gather controversial content. This tends to give these places a bad reputation which pushes away the non-controversial content.<p>The best bet would probably to take a non-controversial niche, start there, and try and integrate well with YT to keep down switching costs. Its still hard to provide actual added value to such a niche. Alternatively one might take a controversial niche with wide acceptance. For example, gun channels or LGBTQ+ channels.

    "text": "The complexity here is that there are multiple parties involved: the copyright holder, who suspects there may have been an infringement; the uploader of the potentially infringing content; and the host, who wants as little to do with copyright claims as they can.<p>The DMCA strikes a balance for the copyright holder and the host, by letting the host avoid any liability for the copyright infringement, as long as they enforce valid requests by no longer hosting the content.<p>The new EU law builds on this principle, giving hosts more responsibility to check whether copyright might be being infringed. I&#x27;m strongle against the idea, but I can see the logic that the host is best-placed to actively monitor all uploaded content.<p>A big issue I have, both with the DMCA and this new legislation, is that there&#x27;s no balancing in the direction of the uploader. Aggressive solutions like your proposal do address this imbalance, but they don&#x27;t do anything to address the actual concerns each side has.<p>If we want more reasonable copyright laws in this arena going forward, we should also be pushing for an uploader&#x27;s right to appeal, as a balance against the rights of and affordances for the other two parties:\n* There should be an &#x27;appeals&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;counterclaim&#x27; process for content uploaders to take responsibility for the content. Presumably, to balance against the copyright holder&#x27;s needs, they should submit their name and address when they claim that their content is non-infringing.\n* From the host&#x27;s side, the uploader following this process should remove all responsibility for that content from them, so they have no concern about liability and can re-enable access to the content.\n* From the copyright holder&#x27;s side, they need to be able to seek recourse if they still think the content is infringing. This can be done by taking the uploader to court, using the details they have provided.<p>I desperately hope this new legislation fails, but I think you were spot-on about aiming for a &#x27;fair balance&#x27;, and even acheiving that would be a great improvement.",

Copyright owner provides written notification of the alleged infringement.<p>The notification has to provide reasonably sufficient information to allow Google to locate the alleged infringing material; provide contact information for the claimant; include a statement that the claimant has a good faith believe that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and a statement that the information the claim is accurate, and that the claimant is authorized to act for the owner.<p>2. Google then has to remove or disable the material, and take reasonable steps to notify the uploader of the issue.<p>If the uploader does not make a counter notification, it looks like that&#x27;s the end of Google&#x27;s obligations.<p>If the uploader files a counter notification, Google has to notify the claimant. If the claimant does not file a lawsuit against the uploader within 14 days, Google has to restore the material.<p>Note that nothing in here seems to require Google to actually <i>look<\/i> at the material and decide if they think it is infringing. Nor does it require them to proactively seek to find infringing material and notify content providers or block such material. They just have to check that the claimant (and the uploader if they get a counter notice) have included the things in their notice that the law requires. They should be able to automate that for most claims.<p>The ContentID system seems to be going far beyond what DMCA requires them to do to keep their safe harbor. I wonder why they are doing that? Maybe because they want to also be content sellers, and so want to keep the content providers happy with them?",

You will need to employ 96000 people 24&#x2F;7 to check all videos. Of course, they can&#x27;t work 24&#x2F;7, so a more realistic figure is 150000 people.

Probably there is a legal hiccup laying here -- you either have reasonable suspicion that the material you show is copyrighted, or you acknowledge your algorithms and AI suck and you require crowd-sourcing. Kind of a lose-lose legally, and they would possibly introduce liability.<p>Recall the goal of Google is to avoid liability via the statement &quot;we are pretty good and have really low false negatives&quot;, and have as few false positives as not to make the platform unusable.<p>Google does not care about content creators or propagation of knowledge (instructive videos) and ideas. Simple statement here. Google engineers might (at least the friends I have), but not as a whole organization.<p>But yeah crowd-sourcing is a good way to do a second sifting through results. I know it is being used, by Google and others, already to classify video sources.",
