A perfect recipe for people to argue past each other about it.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that one of his conclusions was to end or replace gender-based diversity programs at Google. Given that, it&#x27;s easy to understand why people would be upset. If gender-based diversity programs are responsible for qualified women getting jobs that they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have gotten due to bias, then the lack of that program means those women wouldn&#x27;t have gotten those jobs.",

Please have a woman you care about in your life, preferably one in tech, read this and then ask their opinion of the piece.<p>The &quot;treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group&quot; sentiment of the author is fine except that we have hundreds of years of doing just this in order to oppress and disenfranchise groups of people. Diversity programs are not about lowering the bar, they are about outreach and working against institutionalized racism and sexism which has created the distribution of wealth and education and work culture that we have today. Given the massive disparity we see in tech it&#x27;s ridiculous that this individual felt the need to lambast the relatively minimal amount of work being done to foster a more diverse and inclusive culture across the industry.<p>If one of the things you have to deal with as a woman in tech is seeing 10 page pseudo-intellectual manifestos about your inherent inferiority at performing in technical and leadership roles published at one of the premier tech companies in the world, and then see that piece supported on the most popular tech social sites then it&#x27;s no wonder we have the gender gap we see today.<p>When somebody&#x27;s views are being attacked for being misogynistic and alienating to their female colleagues, it is not suppression of free speech and diverse political opinion it is common decency. Nobody is infringing on your free speech but they will respond. All of these cries of &#x27;authoritarian left-wing thought-police&#x27; makes me think We need a manifesto on White Male Persecution Complex Culture in Tech.<p>[disclaimer: I work at Google, my words are my own and not my employers]",

In particular, it conflates diversity sourcing programs with a lower hiring bar.<p>As an engineer who&#x27;s done a fair bit of volunteer recruiting work as well as conducted interviews, my experience has been that race- and gender-specific programs are used exclusively as outreach, sourcing, and mentorship tools. James claims there are <i>&quot;hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar for “diversity” candidates by decreasing the false negative rate,&quot;</i> which strikes me as untrue. Regardless of how they are sourced, once candidates are in the interview pipeline their are all treated exactly as rigorously as one another.<p>In other words, recruiters are responsible for finding, reaching out to, and advocating for candidates. Once they source the candidate they &quot;throw them over the fence&quot; to the cold, hard interview process, which involves experienced interviewers and a hiring committee of senior-tenure engineers. The aim is to ensure you can trust that those who make it out how the hiring committee to be top-notch.<p>After years and years of working at the company I haven&#x27;t heard even a whisper of complaint among anyone about the quality of people we&#x27;re hiring. After working with people of all stripes I can say I haven&#x27;t met a single person where I thought to myself &quot;how did this loser get through the filter.&quot;",

Diversity has absolutely nothing to do with diversity of thought, and is only concerned with normalizing racial&#x2F;gender composition to present the illusion that discrimination and biological variation are non-existent (except for discrimination against males, whites, and Asians, because for some reason it&#x27;s not considered discrimination if it affects them). It&#x27;s not about doing the right thing, it&#x27;s about PR - hence the decision to cave in to whatever the pitchforks are demanding.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that honest criticism of diversity policies and gender issues is considered taboo enough to get someone fired.

Often backed by very flimsy arguments that often has a frightening lack of details and specifics. What I find the most absurd is that I can&#x27;t recall ever having heard of an actual woman who was discriminated, instead one is very happy to talk about various summary statistics.<p>The point is that these accusations have been raised, and in fact come to be accepted as the established truth. Almost everyone, at least in public, agrees with the feminist viewpoint. Somehow, despite these opinions being universally agreed upon, many are not interpreting the manifesto in the context of a defence against these accusations.<p>Finally, I can to some extent understand the need for affirmative action However, one question I find interesting to think about is, when are we going to stop it? When has society gotten &quot;good enough&quot; that we no longer need these policies?<p>It seems society have made very good progress towards grater equality in the last few decades. Yet when reading the news, discrimination facing women and minorities seem worse than ever. Instead of relaxing affirmative action as society is becoming increasingly equal, the situation is the other way around with a never ending stream of demands for new exceptions, extra initiatives and so on.",

Let&#x27;s assume men that are short and men that are tall are biologically equivalent, meaning biological trait that might surface are evenly distributed. Now let&#x27;s inject 100 men with varying height into the general population, and... Uh oh there&#x27;s a skew in leadership position and income. Taller men have better positions and have higher income.<p>People who are taller all have tall coworkers. They work for a boss that&#x27;s a little bit taller than them. Some of them start thinking that you know this is probably just natural, men who are shorter are just biologically unsuited to be a leader. They aren&#x27;t aggresive enough and they just don&#x27;t have as much drive, it&#x27;s probably just written in their DNA.<p>The short men no matter how much they perform or how brilliant they are always seem to be sidelined for promotion. Some of them make it pretty far but they&#x27;re performing 50x compared to their peers, and theyre always sidelined when it comes to executive promotions. Other executives think: &quot;this guy is brilliant but what would people think about us... We better promote the other less brilliant tall guy. We could retain investor confidence.&quot;\nSome of them break out and try to start a company. They can&#x27;t get any funding, and no one wants to join their company. People think its a company run by a short guy, this guy is brilliant but he&#x27;s not going to do well in the long term, so they end up joining start ups that have tall guys.<p>This network effects over a million times.<p>Now let&#x27;s take people&#x27;s perception, and assume people perceive men and women exactly the same. The catch here is that women are one standard deviation shorter than men. Just from height you&#x27;ll see a discrepancy between men and women representation in leadership positions.\nLet&#x27;s end height discrimination first.\nI believe this is a simpler explanation of the discrepancies in representation.",

The more interesting problem with medicine is that the pipeline is basically at equity (close to 50&#x2F;50 male&#x2F;female graduates).<p>However, according to this article (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amino.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-the-gender-gap-is-shifting-in-medicine-medical-specialties-by-gender&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amino.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-the-gender-gap-is-shifting-in-med...</a>) even medicine is seeing severe gender gaps based on the specialty that is chosen.<p>This was their analysis:<p>Only 7% of all orthopedic surgeons; 15% of orthopedic surgeons beginning their practice in 2015<p>9% of urologists; 21% of urologists beginning their practice in 2015<p>13% of cardiologists; 25% of cardiologists beginning their practice in 2015<p>Why are there so few women working in these specialties? According to Mayo Clinic&#x27;s Ian Mwangi, “There’s a stereotype that orthopedic surgeons are jocks, that the field requires brute strength.” There’s a lengthy feature article on Orthopedics Today that explores other reasons women aren’t entering orthopedics, including less exposure to the field in medical school, discouragement among advising faculty and deans, and the perception of poor work-life balance.<p>NPR explains that there may be gender disparity among urologists because of a &quot;misconception of the field ... that urologists treat male problems like prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction.&quot;<p>Women seeking a career in cardiology face similar deterrents, including the “impairments to family planning, poor work-life balance, and perceived radiation risks,” according to this fellows&#x27; perspective published in the Journal of American College of Cardiology.<p>In most of my research, I found that a lack of female role models was also a key reason why more women didn’t enter these specialties, echoing a trend across industries.

Given her incredible talent I find this hard to believe.<p>I still catch her checking out CS course material and even her mom argues with her over this. She can get her a top position in SWE team at top company as she is a senior analyst there.<p>Yet she still insists she likes graphic design more.\nEither we are pushing women too much to get into CS or there is something inherently wrong in this field that disallows them to get in, it might be the culture, it might be the hours, i don&#x27;t know..<p>For her, I know for a fact the issue wasn’t that she found it too difficult, she had top grades during her last semester in CS<p>I should also mention both the university and the company have diversity programs in place to embrace minorities.<p>Anyways, just my own personal experience with this issue<p>I am really baffled.",

Women are not inferior on average, but they are different. This is fact. There are jobs which are much harder for male to handle compared to female, and I am not talking about child care or something, but mostly stressful jobs requiting multitasking. Males are bad at multitasking on average (not to be confused with time management and doing many things, but sequentially).<p>I know a guy, a chess trainer who trains girls. He always tries to schedule matches based on trainee period cycle to let his girls do their best. That is intellectual sport, chess, fair play. This is damn biology, one cannot deny it by corporate policy.<p>So the fact is, like it on not, there are jobs which male handle better on average, there are jobs which women handle better on average, just because brain of both sexes is equally effective, but not equal. And this is great. I am more than happy to ask my female colleague for something she is better at (and I am not talking about delegating boring staff, I have male juniors for this), because diversity is good.<p>Root of the problem, as I see it, is that jobs male are better on average are also much better paid on average. It is not fair, but is another fact one cannot deny. Nobody ever discussed males being underpaid. Nobody ever discussed why we have too many women at some jobs (like cashier or janitor in my country) and how we should help men get equal and have a chance to get that jobs too. Because honestly, that jobs are too hard for male to handle and not paid well enough to fight for them. I saw a few man cashier working side-by-side with women colleagues. It was pure struggle, they were so over-stressed trying to serve 3-4 customers in parallel, I really pity them. But being software engineer with 6-digit salary is quite different story.

As always, statistics do not say anything about any individual in any of the populations. Statistics does also not address the potential underlying causes of the distribution differences. Using statistical arguments to judge individuals is usually referred to as prejudice or discrimination. Many countries have adopted laws and regulations to curb some select forms of discrimination, while permitting others.",

It&#x27;s more than politics. I think it may be about what Truth actually is.<p>For example (and I&#x27;m feeling my way here, forgive me my more philosophically minded friends) that what we are people are clashing about is what is true, useful and socially agreed upon to believe in. It&#x27;s like the social contract - if we somehow all accepted that behaving in society was untrue and so stopped operating in society, it would collapse. So there is an accepted truth that living in a society is a useful and helpful thing.<p>The same with sexual stereotypes. There may be some data here on both sides (The Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Surgery ones come to mind), but it&#x27;s neither useful nor helpful to society, and so if someone says X is untrue then society will emphatically say it is true. You, a human living in society, will defend where and who you live with.<p>Politics is somewhat about the organisation of society. What most people on both sides of this debate cannot see is that they are arguing about something more fundamental.<p>Now - with a cheery hello to my future employers who will hopefully (I&#x27;m a data scientist) be using some advanced data software to tie up my contrarian HN posts with my actual identity, I&#x27;m not at all surprised the employee was fired. It goes against the culture that he is in. I do believe the discussion should be had, and repeated, debunked and defended like you imagine a real debate to work like.",

    "text": "We haven&#x27;t seen anything yet. What we&#x27;re witnessing is the transition from capitalism to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s Brave New World, and things like this termination are an obvious milestone. That may sound like a bold claim but let me explain.<p>Allow me to back up a little bit. First off some context: a lot of people don&#x27;t realize it but we are a lot closer to a post-scarcity world than the world would have you think. Check out this chart which shows GDP per capita since the 1950&#x27;s. The productivity gains since the 1950&#x27;s have been absolutely incredible, and the quality of life back then was pretty good. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;A939RX0Q048SBEA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;A939RX0Q048SBEA</a><p>Have you ever noticed there&#x27;s never any dialogue about encouraging men to be stay at home dads, or reducing the overall household number of hours worked per week? Never. The dialogue is always about the &quot;wage gap&quot; and &quot;women have value too&quot; and &quot;rape culture&quot; and &quot;microaggressions&quot;. Men who are stay at home dads still get shamed just as much as they did during the 1950&#x27;s. This is how you know there&#x27;s something wrong - there is never any serious dialogue about actual equality. Income has in no way, shape, or form, kept up the with the GDP per capita shown in the chart above. There&#x27;s never any explorations of policies that would actually increase equality, like restricting the number of &quot;investment properties&quot; a man or woman can own, behavior which is clearly parasitic. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:US_productivity_and_...</a>\nIt&#x27;s not in corporate interests to have people have actual equality. Increasing the labor pool without discussions of actual equality makes it so that people can be kept in debt, wages go down and the nexus of power moves away from the family and towards the corporation, which is what is happening.<p>&quot;Women have value and should be working full time too&quot;. The implication here is that if you are not working for money you have no value. Despite common belief, in fact it IS possible to generate value outside of a money context. Many of the world&#x27;s greatest achievements have occurred outside a money context, eg. the discovery of calculus, wikipedia, linux, countless famous works of art, literature, and philosophy. By saying that you only have value if you earn money is throwing many of the world&#x27;s most accomplished people under a bus. The reason why &quot;money is the only form of value&quot; is such a horrible mentality is that it leads to people like Mozart dying in poverty and being thrown into a ditch, which actually happened.<p>Check out charts of combined household numbers of hours worked, you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s going way UP not down, despite the GDP per capita chart shown above. There is clearly something dark in that picture. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;working&#x2F;chart17.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;working&#x2F;chart17.pdf</a>\nI don&#x27;t think these are idle complaints - feminism in its current form is an ideology that&#x27;s on a direct collision course with the whole &#x27;robots are about to take all the jobs&#x27; reality, which I think is going to come a lot sooner than we realize, and when these two phenoma collide, what&#x27;s going to happen is that it&#x27;s not going to be equality (sorry folks) it&#x27;s going to be Brave New World, an immensely stratified society.<p>I work in one of Alphabet&#x27;s departments where everything you do is constantly monitored. Your teammates conduct detailed psychometric analyses of you, beyond the simple perf of yesteryear. It&#x27;s beyond cult-like. It&#x27;s Brave New World.",

But my view is that it&#x27;s best to never discuss politics or religion (and sometimes sports this one depends) at the job since it can rub people the wrong way. It&#x27;s not fun working where you&#x27;ve either ticked someone off or you&#x27;ve been ticked off by someone else. Some polite distancing of one&#x27;s beliefs from their work life I feel is more important than trying to offer any advice to HR, even if it has some merit. It&#x27;s just asking for a pink slip and a black mark on your resume.<p>But the biggest confusion I think is how conservatives react to this situation for me. I use to be an avid fan of Buckley and use to read the National Review regularly as a teenager (yes I&#x27;m weird). So when I see conservatives lash out at Google over their right to fire anyone at will or on the basis that the employee is disrupting the environment at work (be it rightful or not from the point of view of fairness) I see hypocrisy of the most base kind. Conservatism in the United States values the freedom of companies, employees, and private citizens to associate and disassociate on their own. If Google wants to hire Mutualists like myself and not hire a GOP or Democrat then they should be on the principles of American Conservatism have their choice respected and not challenged in court or in some dishonest manner which violates the property rights of others. To attempt to walk back or moderate the position of free association on the basis that might hurt some people who share conservative values is to undermine the very basis of conservatism in my opinion. Basically, you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too. Either all businesses and private citizens have the freedom of association (and disassociation) or they do not have that right. It stinks but consistency in political ideologies is an important metric to understanding whether or not an ideology can sustain itself. If American Conservatism cannot sustain itself under such consistency then the ideology is flawed and should be reformed such that it can give a conditional freedom of association on a consistent basis both in political theory and in terms of law (i.e. accepting that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and subsequent additions to the law are warranted and consistent with said ideological grounds). Mind you, I&#x27;m not a conservative at all but I&#x27;m speaking from my beliefs that I held many years ago and how I interpreted American Conservatism. But I recall Buckley holding a similar view as the one I described. And it would take a mighty strong argument for me to be convinced that the contrary is consistent with American Conservatism and conservatism as a whole.",

There <i>are</i> obvious, hardwired evolutionary specialization among sexes of all species. Sexes are evolutionary innovation to achieve better survival rates (achieved by the process of evolurionary trial and error and natural selection) not some stupid religious nonsense. So, there is no equality in principle, by definition, by design. The notion of equal <i>rights</i> is completely different story, it is social realm - few levels up from underlying biology.<p>There is not a single doubt that biology dominates and partially determines psychology (the nature part of the Nature and Nurture whole). Biology also dominates sociology - most of human traditions and social norms are deeply grounded in biological differences and specialization - there is nothing to talk about. Animal behavioral patterns, which could be called &quot;traditions of species&quot; are, obviously, determined by biology and environmental factors.<p>At least few stereotypes produced by various human cultures (products of social formations, partially determined by biology) are reflections to various extend of these real, existing, &quot;material&quot; fundamental differences captured in traditions. Dismissal of all the stereotypes as a category is plain stupidity.<p>Hipsters and snowflakes who are trying to gain attention by &quot;challenging&quot; objective reality with their naive memes (the ridiculous attempts to redefine what sexes are and what it is for with &quot;third sex&quot; nonsense is an obvious example) at very least raise some brows.<p>Notice that I am not in the least &quot;conservative&quot;, I am principal and scientific. There are evolutional and biological reasons <i>why</i> this or that aspect of sex differences emerged and what is for. Whatever is valid for all species applies to humans too, no matter what liberal arts graduates would say about man&#x27;s superiority.<p>Nature forms and dominates, Nurture varies and adapts. There is not a single doubt that equal <i>rights</i> must be given to both sexes (there are only two of them) and equal rights must be protected.<p>This is where the notion of equality ends. Equality of sexes is a hipster&#x27;s utter nonsense, not because conservatives think so, or some popular religious text says so, but for straightforward scientific reasons, anatomical and neurobiological. This is so-called objective reality, and opinions and memes of current snowflakes are simply non-applicable.",

    "text": "You know, I actually thought Sundar&#x27;s response to this whole thing was actually quite on point. He addresses the issue of needing to be able to discuss points in the memo that are open to discussion (such as the effectiveness of a policy and how to make things more inclusive for all); and at the same time addresses the hostile work environment that was produced as a result of the surrounding context. It sounds like moving forward there is a lot of work to be done to improve the culture and implement policies that can foster diversity of thought as well.<p>&quot;\nThis has been a very difficult time. I wanted to provide an update on the memo that was circulated over this past week.\nFirst, let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace. Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects “each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination.”\nThe memo has clearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender. Our co-workers shouldn’t have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting, they have to prove that they are not like the memo states, being “agreeable” rather than “assertive,” showing a “lower stress tolerance,” or being “neurotic.”\nAt the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent. So to be clear again, many points raised in the memo—such as the portions criticizing Google’s trainings, questioning the role of ideology in the workplace, and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all—are important topics. The author had a right to express their views on those topics—we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions.\nThe past few days have been very difficult for many at the company, and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree—while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct. I’d encourage each of you to make an effort over the coming days to reach out to those who might have different perspectives from your own. I will be doing the same.\nI have been on work related travel in Africa and Europe the past couple of weeks and had just started my family vacation here this week. I have decided to return tomorrow as clearly there’s a lot more to discuss as a group—including how we create a more inclusive environment for all.\n&quot;",

    "text": "i absolutely hate the situation that we have found ourselves in. gender and race politics have become totally divorced from the issues of gender and race. firing people who speak their mind is not going to help women in tech and it wont help black kids from being shot in the street in chicago or oakland. not a single person i have ever known who played the politically correct game has ever lifted a single finger to help black people or a little girls interested in tech. the sad truth is that gender politics is now a game of virtue signalling -- a status game among liberal people to see who is the most virtuous, the kindest and most thoughtful. meanwhile, any person who does not fit into a beneficiary position in this game (for example the entire middle section of the united states) is treated with savage cruelty. it is astonishing to see my ultra liberal friends whine endlessly about how unfair life is, how painful life is for certain people, and then turn around and in the same breath condemn and disparage millions of people for absolutely no reason. the truth is that a truly kind person reserves kindness for everyone, and even someone who might be mean or unpleasant at first -- i have found that kindness is much more effective at changing peoples perspective than anything else, so if you want mid-westerners to stop being racist, remember that being horrible and mean to them probably wont make them see things from your perspective.<p>i think there is some kind of effect where people who are really good at solving complicated puzzles that are right in front of their faces are not so good at solving logical issues that are less tangible or more long term. thats one of my theories, because a lot of people i know that arent dumb at all seem to totally buy into the gender politics thing, even though their beliefs totally fly in the face of logic. maybe its me who is wrong, and there is some subtle aspect of this whole thing that i am not grasping. either way, we are all in this together. its important to be patient with each other and to never allow ourselves to descend into savagery and hatred. and if you do find yourself behaving like that, its ok. we all make mistakes, dust yourself off and try again. i know i have.",

Yes, but the atmosphere is already poisoned by events like this and the firing of Brendan Eich.

High on a hill overlooking the town, the racist tree grew where the grass was half clover. Children would visit during the sunlit hours and ask for apples, and the racist tree would shake its branches and drop the delicious red fruit that gleamed without being polished. The children ate many of the racist tree&#x27;s apples and played games beneath the shade of its racist branches. One day the children brought Sam, a boy who had just moved to town, to play around the racist tree.<p>&quot;Let Sam have an apple,&quot; asked a little girl.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think so. He&#x27;s black,&quot; said the tree. This shocked the children and they spoke to the tree angrily, but it would not shake its branches to give Sam an apple, and it called him a nigger.<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t believe the racist tree is such a racist,&quot; said one child. The children momentarily reflected that perhaps this kind of behavior was how the racist tree got its name.<p>It was decided that if the tree was going to deny apples to Sam then nobody would take its apples. The children stopped visiting the racist tree.\nThe racist tree grew quite lonely. After many solitary weeks it saw a child flying a kite across the clover field.<p>&quot;Can I offer you some apples?&quot; asked the tree eagerly.<p>&quot;Fuck off, you goddamn Nazi,&quot; said the child.<p>The racist tree was upset, because while it was very racist, it did not personally subscribe to Hitler&#x27;s fascist ideology. The racist tree decided that it would have to give apples to black children, not because it was tolerant, but because otherwise it would face ostracism from white children.<p>And so, social progress was made.",

If less than 25% of CS graduates are female, which is currently the case, it strongly suggests that attempting to make the engineering team 50% female will result in a lower hiring bar for women. That means that the overall point of the authors manifesto, that programs designed to specifically increase the ratio of female engineers are unfair, is true.<p>We need to do something about the low number of women going into tech fields in school. Punishing companies for not hiring women when the vast majority of candidates are men is a perverse incentive that is biased against men and doesn&#x27;t fix the real problem.<p>It&#x27;s like punishing someone for taking more yellow onions at the market when there&#x27;s 3 times as many nice looking ones as white onions. The right way to fix the imbalance is to increase the supply of white onions. In the real world, farmers would begin switching to white onions and the supply would increase.

Diversity is good in many cases but you can easily have one company filled with women and one company filled with men and having the group of women being of very diverse backgrounds and the group of men being of very diverse backgrounds. You still have diversity. Hell you can even have a group of women being of exactly the same background and a group of men being of exactly the same background and do really really well.<p>The idea the women brings something to the table simply by being women or that men does simply by being men is what is so wrong with this whole conversation. The individual brings something to the table but the individual needs to fit into a culture not being force fed into it.<p>Having hired and interviewed a great deal of people in my life in the tech industry I think it&#x27;s fair to say that most companies will look for ANY talent they can get to. Talent is extremely hard to find and being a woman or being a man is not enough.<p>More women will hopefully start companies and I hope some of them will hire only women if they feel it&#x27;s better for their culture. But until they start doing that to the same extent that men does and until they start to the same extent having interest in technology early on, gender based anything will always be hurting more than it will help because just having gender diversity isn&#x27;t going to make your company better off there simply aren&#x27;t anything proving that.<p>And just to be clear. I have worked with women and men far better than me. When it comes to the best there really isn&#x27;t any difference.

Given that, it&#x27;s easy to understand why people would be upset. If gender-based diversity programs are responsible for qualified women getting jobs that they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have gotten due to bias, then the lack of that program means those women wouldn&#x27;t have gotten those jobs.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t the same be true about any non-optimal hiring practices and procedures though?<p>Google is pretty famous for constantly evaluating and tuning their hiring processes, because presumably - they sometimes fail to hire qualified people, and sometimes hire unqualified people.  They want to tune their process so they are as close to 0 as humanly possible for each of those cases.<p>Maybe the guy is a sexist and racist asshole, I don&#x27;t know him - but if I give him the benefit of the doubt and read him charitably, I take it to mean he&#x27;s saying gender-based diversity programs might produce worse ratios of qualified&#x2F;unqualified hires, and unqualified&#x2F;qualified passes than some of his other proposals.  In other words, tune the hiring process, as it relates specifically to diversity hires, to improve the ratio of qualified&#x2F;unqualified workers.<p>I have no idea if that idea is crazy or sensible, but it doesn&#x27;t strike me as being obviously one way or the other.  I&#x27;m sure with all the attention this is getting somebody, somewhere, who may be experts in these things could offer their take on it.",

It&#x27;s unfortunate that we can&#x27;t all achieve a baseline level of civility that abstracts away a person&#x27;s biological character.<p>But I personally find it inflammatory to equate the concept of diversity with differences in sex and race in the first place. This tends disturbingly towards institutionalized stereotyping (e.g. &quot;all Asians are nerdy and softspoken, so we&#x27;re going to lump them into the same cohort and exert an implicit negative bias against them&quot;). It&#x27;s also particularly vacuous in that our notion of &#x27;diversity&#x27; is thereby premised chiefly on superficial appearances - &#x27;you look different, therefore you must be the kind of different we need&#x27;.<p>One would think the more equitable philosophy would be to strive towards a world in which we stop making exactly those kinds of distinctions and instead judge people on the content of their character and the value they can create.<p>I find it highly reductionist to conflate people challenging biased hiring practices with people challenging diversity more generally. There are likely some in the tech world who are genuinely bigoted and misogynist. I would hope, however, that a larger share are simply perplexed that hiring practices in engineering would be predicated on anything other than an assessment of raw merit.<p>My final point is this: as long as we continue to perpetuate diversity practices that emphasize sex and race in any way, some classes of people are going to be harmed. Sometimes that&#x27;s more obvious to the Asian male who grew up in a tough part of NYC under difficult circumstances than it is to the affluent Black female who grew up in a world willing to bias opportunities unfairly in her favor (when some other less fortunate Black female really needed the leg up).",

It was about motivations women have given their biological traits.<p>Google, Facebook run unconscious bias training which has no support in scientific research. At best it does not work at all.<p>It really was not misogyny.<p>The manifesto is inspired by Jordan B Peterson, and that guy is not a misogynist or a racist or whatever. He&#x27;s a psychologist that complains about HR departments of the world that are filled with other psychologists and sociologists. He thinks they have to start looking at science and get to the root of the issue. Unfortunately, they use methods that have no support in science and misuse their position to push their ideology.<p>One good example is Iran. Where women are oppressed. Yet they choose STEM more often than not. How come our free&#x2F;tolerant culture allows women to move away from STEM fields, and their oppressive culture pushes women towards STEM fields? Maybe motivations of free and oppressed women are different and free women just don&#x27;t want to work in STEM? Abilities of men and women are identical (or at least the bell curves overlap significantly). Motivations depend on biology and culture. Motivations are what is differing and no unconscious bias training will fix that.<p>For example, I know plenty IT women that don&#x27;t want to work in offices that don&#x27;t have dress code. They all went working in banks. How is anyone going to fix that bias if women just like dressing well (on average) and being in a dressed up fancy environment.",

Now, if you research, you&#x27;ll see that statistically women are less likely to negotiate as high a salary as men. It would make sense, given that research, to create a women-only program for teaching salary negotiation skills, right?<p>Except what if the bell curve around those averages was wide? Well then there&#x27;s a number of men that suck at negotiation, and a number of women for whom those classes would be a waste of time. So the likely better program would be one where negotiation ability was evaluated at the start, and only candidates that needed training received it. Statistically, this program would have more women than men in it, but an exclusive program would not have been ideal.<p>Maybe I missed the part where he called women inferior?? The gist of his document as I saw it was that only looking at deltas between averages is a myopic approach (makes sense), and that programs need to consider that there&#x27;s often a wide spread between those averages (also makes sense).<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between creating a safe work environment so you don&#x27;t alienate otherwise interested talent, versus artificially stacking the deck to create diversity for diversity&#x27;s sake. The latter approach, particularly when poorly evaluating the data (as the author points out) can cause significant damage to an organization.<p>Case and point - how is it that a Googler discussing &quot;White Male Persecution Complex&quot; and &quot;majority privilege&quot; is contributing to the discussion of workplace diversity dynamics, but a (now ex-) Googler internally writing about dogmatic diversity and the need for nuance should be fired?<p>Are any of your co-workers white? Male? How is it that your assumption that they&#x27;ve had a silver spoon in their mouths their whole life not insensitive and inflamitory?

By abstracting this away, your bias against the candidate will only be your bias alone in review.

There is a price to pay for companies that want to keep their employees living in the office.<p>When you want them to go to company parties, the company gym, eat at the company cafeteria, and in the case of Facebook provide company housing, and generally spend a lot of time in the office, then at some point the company is going to discover that their employees have a diverse set of political beliefs as well as beliefs about gender&#x2F;race&#x2F;etc, and they will want to express these beliefs over lunch, and at the gym, and at parties, and in social media. They will also want to express those opinions to their friends, which happen to be colleagues. Now you have the big political debates that used to take place in bars and other recreational areas happening in the workplace. That&#x27;s the cost of the all encompassing office.<p>Another ingredient in this toxic mix is that a lot of younger people blur the lines between social and professional, and this has been happening for a long time now. As soon as a critical mass lets their work life bleed into their personal life, this is going to end badly and lead to more oppressive workplace structures, as the company isn&#x27;t going to suddenly democratize decision making. That&#x27;s why management needs to be very circumspect about the scope of policies they mandate for their workers.<p>This tearing down of barriers is happening everywhere -- people do personal activities on their corporate laptops, they use their corporate phones for personal calls, they do personal projects on company time and company projects on personal time. They use their social media accounts to talk about company projects, etc.<p>The only viable option is for the company to retreat from these spheres and to focus on doing your job. They should not ask for social media accounts in the hiring process, nor should they focus so much on &quot;culture&quot;. But that&#x27;s inconsistent with also making the job a lifestyle and keeping the employees working long hours. If you are going to have people spend 50 and 60 hours working closely with each other, then things like political disagreements turn into HR concerns, and are addressed with the same intelligence and care for worker rights as you would expect from a typical HR department.",

You&#x27;re putting words in his mouth and misunderstanding the point he&#x27;s making.<p>Just to clear things up. A false negative is someone qualified who gets rejected. A false positive is someone unqualified who gets hired. He claimed that diversity candidates have a lower false negative, not a higher false positive. The &quot;cold, hard interview process&quot; you refer to is both technically challenging but also has a degree of arbitrariness to it. Google gets so many applicants that it makes sense to design a process that has as few false positives as possible without regard to the false negatives.<p>I knew someone that applied to Google because our former manager had gone to Google and wanted to hire him again. He did really well in the interviews (he was recommended by all of them) but was rejected because the hiring committee felt his GPA, for an art degree unrelated to the work he&#x27;d be doing at Google, was too low. Our former manager brought him on as a contractor instead and he eventually transitioned to full-time and he has been very successful there for almost a decade since. Most people never find out the reason they weren&#x27;t hired. The only reason he ever did is because he knew the hiring manager personally and, even then, he didn&#x27;t learn the reasoning until after he&#x27;d transitioned to FTE. Aside from the fact that his manager was able to circumvent the hiring process to, over the course of a year, bring someone he wanted in, this is a rare example of a known false negative.<p>As an outsider with no access to Google&#x27;s hiring records, I can&#x27;t say for sure how many false negatives there are, but I have to assume there are a lot more people like him that don&#x27;t get hired. I&#x27;ve met good engineers during my career that were rejected by Google. And I&#x27;ve worked with enough former-Google engineers that weren&#x27;t that impressive. The only thing I can say is that I&#x27;ve never met an engineer who worked or works for Google that I felt was terrible, which is more than I can say for most companies.<p>It sounds like the complaint being made is that Google used a situation almost no other company has, a constant surplus of people passing their interview process and took the expedient route to increasing their minority hiring...they&#x27;re just ensuring that minorities aren&#x27;t cut from that last, somewhat arbitrary stage of the hiring process. They know that committee is mostly deciding between candidates who would all be good hires because the process up to that point will have already eliminated the unqualified candidates. It&#x27;s both a reasonable strategy to quickly increase the number of minority hires without sacrificing on quality and it&#x27;s a lower bar.",

It&#x27;s certainly possible to pull more women and people of color into your hiring pool, and you don&#x27;t ever need to turn down a single person based on their white skin color to do it. The universities you hire from and your degree requirements for applicants can both have a significant impact on things and it&#x27;s easy to adjust those.<p>The downside is that some qualified candidates (white man and woman of color alike) will potentially miss out on jobs once the candidate pool is grown, because you&#x27;ve pulled a bunch of extremely talented people into the pool who set the bar higher.

See a Damore&#x27;s defiant answer to Reuters.<p>Should explain it well. He knew very well what result will be, thats why he put his name on memo. He knew that SJWs at google will pressure HR to fire him. Apparently he prepared the ground with NLRB complains. And if you have read full non redacted memo with sources and pictures you can see he was very careful with wording and he pointed out that controversial things are not his opinions but he provided other sources for them. There is nothing Google can use on real court (they have enough to convict him according to SJW norms in echo chamber court though) to prove that he was misogynistic.<p>Also he is getting a lot of support from right leaning and centrist media. I would say that way more people support him than support Google firing him.<p>Timing is also in his advantage. Recently google disabled youtube and gmail account of Jordan Peterson, youtube announced thy plan to isolate videos with controversial views despite not braking ToS, and accusation that google manipulates search results to favor left talking points are around for long time. There are a lot of articles, blogs and videos about those topics currently and this is quite effective smearing campaign against google that pushes users to think about alternatives to google products.",

I am entirely convinced that he did prove his entire point about the political and moral echo chamber that is Googles Mountain View office. Though he did not do it within the letter. Google helped him by firing him.<p>Where you&#x27;ve made some poor logical leaps are: there is zero evidence that he shouted out his obviously controversial beliefs to the world. As far as I can tell this memo did not go to the whole world by his doing. It did not go to the entire Google staff by his doing. In fact, for all we know he was asked for his well thought out opinion on Googles diversity training and gave it to the appropriate people who did not respect the fact that he was giving his opinion to a small group and began forwarding it on. You might say I have no proof of this, and you&#x27;d be right. But you have no proof that he blasted this to the whole world.<p>Additionally, he was a number of things in the memo but he was not an unhinged idiot. It reads like someone who was asked for his opinion on the training that was going on and whether there was value in making it mandatory.<p>I have been asked in professional settings for my opinion on controversial matters. One time I was put into a very troubling position because of my opinion and many people were quite upset. It was uncomfortable for us all. I no longer give my opinion on controversial topics. I keep quiet and do my work and if I disagree with a policy or procedure I find new employment.<p>I am sure the author of this memo has learned his lesson now. He will shut up.

Importantly, <i>nothing changed about the redfish itself.</i> What changed was a new emphasis on using it in a dish.<p>Similarly, lobster went from being a peasant or prisoner food to a delicacy when railways and canning helped extend the demand beyond the northeast US.<p>What if a big part of solving the pipeline problem is simply for companies to demand more diverse candidates because leadership finally start to recognize the research that suggests that diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams on many metrics?

In polls, they are also more likely to question their decision in career choice and have more self doubt about their ability to finish the program. The data that I have seen on this is that it is gender neutral, ie that the doubt caused by being a local minority is similar for both men and women.<p>To make up numbers, if a student has 3 times a high risk of switching a program after a failed exam, the chance that they will graduates will be significant lower. Having a gender segregated education fixes this, but as soon the graduate enters the work market the same phenomenon happen after a failed interview unless they only seek work which is also gender segregated.",

Coding skills can be improved, diversity of backgrounds is also a team strength and one that can&#x27;t be taught.\nSo, one would hope that by forcing hiring diversity now, companies 1) force the white dude monoculture to break down, encouraging 2) more women to see SWE as an appealing opportunity, making 3) their future hiring pipeline and hiring committees sufficiently diverse that they don&#x27;t need to force numbers.<p>Also worth remembering that women CS grads entering the field used to be climbing at the same rate as lawyers and other similar fields, then something changed in the mid-1980s and while the other fields progressed ever-nearer 50%, CS numbers took a nosedive.

I think that outreach and education at all levels to increase the number of candidates from underrepresented groups in the tech hiring pipeline is a great step and that reducing these inequities, beyond being ethical, will create a stronger workforce. Others might disagree and have good reasons to disagree. That is a conversation worth having, but it needs to happen in the historical context in which we find ourselves.<p>Writing a manifesto that claims that the disparity in tech is the result of biological differences that lead women to be inferior at performing in tech and leadership capacities is not the way to start this conversation.

Then it seemed to start believing the ends justify the means - redrawing voting districts, filibustering, etc. And at the same time accepting support from seriously racist and misogynist groups.<p>For example, the Obama birth certificate thing was simply a racist joke when it started. The GOP rank and file should have refused any association with those who suggested it, but because it served their purposes they embraced both the meme and the people promulgating it. The result of that (and more - Clinton trafficking  children in a pizza parlour? I&#x27;m surprised they didn&#x27;t add aliens just for good measure...) is that the GOP is now seen as a party that entertains such nutters.<p>I sympathise that your political system provides just two big boats, so you are forced to row with people you aren&#x27;t comfortable with. In New Zealand we have proportional representation which lets the more... colourful... people have their own boats, which is very healthy because they quickly realise how few people want to join them, and that their views are unpopular.",

    "text": "If you want to argue about tax policy, military policy, or any number of other things where conservatives and liberals have legitimate policy disagreements then by all means do so. I&#x27;m sure Google is a perfectly safe space for such arguments.<p>You seem to be arguing that we need to create a safe space for conservatives to espouse debunked bio-truth garbage that women or blacks are less suited to being engineers or are somehow inferior. Or that conservatives should have &quot;safe fact-free zone&quot; where they can spout nonsense without having anyone call them on it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why so many people are willing to take this Google engineer&#x27;s statements at face value. Actually I think I know why: because it confirms pre-existing beliefs. But even an hour on Google will provide ample evidence that his premises are simply not true. I&#x27;m not taking about J. Random Engineer&#x27;s ramblings on some blog but actual research undertaken by actual sociologists performing experiments and crunching reams and reams of data.<p>Let me repeat that for everyone: His entire argument is based in a long-debunked flawed premise. It isn&#x27;t true and no amount of philosophizing about it will make it true. Your feelings don&#x27;t make it true. The facts are clear. Counter-examples about: look at CS enrollment rates in India for example. The modern western world, especially the United States, socializes women out of computer science and software engineering. It has nothing to do with biological aptitude.<p>Everyone I know of is desperately trying to find qualified candidates to hire. The idea that more-qualified white men are being excluded to fill a &quot;diversity&quot; quota is laughable. Diversity is about expanding the candidate pipeline and providing some support to those people once hired. Maybe if the industry goes through a huge crunch and programmers are being laid-off left and right then there would be an argument there?<p>The other thing I&#x27;ll say is you have to be extremely dense not to either a) understand that you&#x27;re making extraordinary claims or b) touching a potentially controversial topic that could result in massive bad PR if nothing else. Under those circumstances a competent engineer should take some time to gather evidence and make proper citations to peer-reviewed research. It would also be greatly beneficial to present multiple sides to the argument and make fewer sweeping claims. If you&#x27;re going to say something that could easily be interpreted as &quot;my coworkers are less-qualified diversity hires&quot; then approach the topic with some humility, especially if you don&#x27;t have a PhD in sociology.<p>This would be the equivalent of penning a memo claiming people who believe in God are suffering delusions and they are lowering the bar because they go to church on Sunday or for special events when they could be working. Mention that they&#x27;re obviously gullible and represent a security risk to other employees. Go ahead - write that memo and route it around a large employer. See if you&#x27;re still employed a week later (hint: you won&#x27;t be).",

That is the problem.<p>We should be open-minded about everything. Including child labor, ending universal suffrage, and the virtues of Al Qaeda. We should be able to reject bad ideas on their merits, each and every time, because we understand what and why we believe. We should embrace disagreement, because it makes concrete our own worldview.

And it may be that he&#x27;s wrong. It may be that his arguments are completely empty of substance, maybe the studies he cites are pseudoscience. But if a decent number of Googler&#x27;s agree with him, as appears to be the case, then his arguments should be addressed directly, on even ground, on their merits - not shamed into silence.

    "text": "That comes across as unfair by definition, but practically there are no such ways to do what you&#x27;ve claimed.<p>It&#x27;s unfair in the sense that this progressive or far left ideal is allowed to be pushed onto entire organizations and by the media as de facto &quot;right&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;, which is inherently a political position and would likely offend anyone who disagrees with it. If these processes and programs should be publicly enacted on people who disagree with them, it&#x27;s unfair then to disallow any discussion about them under an implicit threat of termination. Google just confirmed that threat is very real. I know many conservatives here (a classical liberal &#x2F; libertarian mostly myself, which is far too &quot;right leaning&quot; for this area) who are actually scared of any political discussion due to this exact threat, even though those with the &quot;correct&quot; opinions can openly discuss them without any fear of repercussions. I don&#x27;t think they should because inherently politics brings out discussion and debate, often vigorous forms of it, and that&#x27;s not generally the best thing for the office, but because that discussion&#x2F;debate is effectively banned here, it&#x27;s completely fine to express leftist and socialist ideals publicly, even if in extremely poor taste.<p>Secondly, if you were to decide to bring up issues with these programs with a person responsible (for instance in Google&#x27;s case, this VP of diversity) you&#x27;d get a predictable dismissal, or they&#x27;d silently drop whatever issue you raise, which means you have no actual means with which to present these viewpoints. She publicly dismissed the entire thing without actually refuting any argument that was made, with language that effectively sounded something like &quot;this is wrong think, and Google doesn&#x27;t agree with this wrong think.&quot; You could do it outside of work, but you lose the context and the specifics of the program, and more importantly the impact any such discussion could have on your immediate environment.<p>These discussions do need to be had, and where they&#x27;re being had, the majority of even liberal minded people tend to agree with the author of this piece, but it&#x27;s hard to know if that&#x27;s a consensus (even at 500,000+ views for instance on each video on YouTube) or if it&#x27;s just an echo chamber because even demanding rigor and evidence of the ideas behind diversity is taboo in far too many places. For instance tptacek can be found in these very comments essentially arguing that this topic of discussion isn&#x27;t open because it&#x27;s been decided. By whom? How can any discussion of highly debatable topics like this be had if people like him and Google are just going to say &quot;it&#x27;s not up for debate because I&#x27;m right&quot; in order to shut down any discussion before it can even begin, hilariously in this case by likening this to discussing child labor or marital rape? It&#x27;s nice to see logical fallacies are alive and very well with people who otherwise seem fairly intelligent.",

My country was proud of women succeeding and even exceeding men in the full spectrum of life. But even during that well-established equality, women were nowhere to be found in Computer Science! It wasn&#x27;t about abilities; it wasn&#x27;t about opportunities - it was about desires and interest! Although many of the teachers were female, very few of the students were, too. And nobody - men or women, - thought something was wrong about that situation, and that something had to change! I believe there are a lot of parasitic organizations in the States that find existence in blowing non-issues out of proportions! Although we&#x27;re equal in intellect, we&#x27;re emotionally different, and we have different interests! So, to try to compensate for that artificially is harmful, not helping genders, races, or ethnicities in any way!

We examined this question in individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), who have atypical exposure to androgens early in development, and their unaffected siblings (total N = 125 aged 9 to 26 years). Females with CAH had more interest in Things versus People than did unaffected females, and variations among females with CAH reflected variations in their degree of androgen exposure.<p><i>Results provide strong support for hormonal influences on interest in occupations characterized by working with Things versus People.</i>&quot;<p>(emphasis mine)<p>This is completely in line with the memo.

This is not a pedantic clarification. I think that for many people the phrase &quot;lowering the bar&quot; overrode the second part about decreasing false negatives. To be fair &quot;lowering the bar&quot; is a very politically loaded term that typically implies that under qualified applicants are (in some people&#x27;s views) unfairly accepted. The author was sloppy for this poor choice of words, and it likely cost him his job.<p>Many people would agree that some hiring practices make non-diverse candidates more likely to be rejected when they&#x27;re qualified, but not that they make diverse candidates more likely to be accepted when unqualified (at least not to a significant degree). In fact, I am one of them. The way my company handles phone screens[1] largely fits this categorization. I think it&#x27;s an acceptable way of bringing in people of backgrounds we don&#x27;t often, and that it does not have a particularly large chance of causing under qualified applicants to be accepted. I do think it&#x27;s fair to criticize the system as discriminating against the non-diverse candidates who don&#x27;t get extra chances at the phone screen, and that stating as such is not saying that diverse candidate&#x27;s had the bar lowered for them. But on the whole I think it&#x27;s justified.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s the link to the comment in which I describe my company&#x27;s phone-screen policy: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14953762\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14953762</a>",

Ultimately she moved onto a bigger company a year or so later (the male&#x2F;female balance wasn&#x27;t given as a reason, the new job was something excited her a lot more).<p>I think saying &#x27;can you HANDLE being in a mostly male work environment&#x27; is not the right wording. But the decision I took to let a potential candidate know they would be working in an otherwise male only office, I would take again in the same circumstance - it WAS something she was interested to know and WAS something that also came up when she started the job.<p>I can&#x27;t speak on behalf of any other women, or scenario in the world, the above is the account of what happened to us.

They have to act in the interest of their shareholders. Correcting for historical imbalances - to the extent that it negatively perverts hiring standards - doesn&#x27;t factor into the calculus of a responsible corporation.<p>* Jews were systematically exterminated in a historical event that was even more recent than slavery. Countless more were left destitute. Why are they any less deserving of positive bias?<p>* There are millions of White people across the Midwest who are dirt poor because manufacturing is no longer a meaningful economic sector in this country. What about them?<p>And more generally, believing that there&#x27;s a contemporary responsibility to correct for historical imbalances leads you down a fantastically absurd rabbit hole. We should instead be addressing the present socioeconomic condition (which will indirectly benefit many of the historically disenfranchised). And that is the job of government. Not corporations.",

Is it to have an perfectly statistically balanced ethnic representation in a company&#x27;s workforce based on global population densities?<p>Will Google know that they&#x27;ve &quot;succeeded&quot; at diversity when 50-odd percent of programmers are women, and the bulk of their workforce are Asian and Indian, since they make up the majority of people on the earth? Is Google&#x27;s goal to have the best programmers they can find, but which fit within the global demographics, because they conclude that there is absolutely no correlation between gender, race, culture, or creed in the aptitude for, or desire to pursue, any given human endeavor?<p>Or, perhaps, to use your example, is the goal to actually increase the preference for non-white, non-males in order to &quot;catch up&quot; other genders and ethnicities until their population groups exhibit the same level of wealth?<p>There are a lot of tangents to all of this, but I&#x27;m trying to stick to the main point here: at what point will we know that American corporations have achieved &quot;enough&quot; diversity, and that outreach programs and hiring preferences are no longer necessary? What&#x27;s the idealized situation look like? (Honest question.) What&#x27;s the measure of success?<p>Also, are companies in other parts of the world trying to achieve the same thing? Are companies, say, in India and China, hiring white and black people like crazy because they also recognize the extreme and urgent need to diversify their workforces? The answer to that question might help clarify the first.",

Not everyone who works in Mountain View is actually <i>from</i> Mountain View.<p>Much of this seems to be about people in positions of power being personally offended at the views of someone with whom they disagree. The proof is in your saying this was &quot;rude&quot; -\n who was that statement being rude to, Marxist intellectuals? Are there a lot of Communists at Google?<p>I don&#x27;t think this reaction has anything to do with keeping some kind of social decorum, or keeping a company running smoothly. In this case the effect is a real-life ideological echo chamber, where the people in power fire anyone whose views they don&#x27;t like, and fear of reprisal from voicing alternate views creates a groupthink mentality.<p>Several people have brought up the idea that because the manifesto author has shown his bias, that means there is no way he could work with someone of a different gender. But this is illogical; <i>tons</i> of people have the same bias! Just because they didn&#x27;t write a manifesto doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t think some of the arguments might be valid. So really, what difference is there in keeping this guy around, whose bias they know and can clearly identify if it ever affects his work relations? Is it worse than the secret biases held by everyone else?<p>--<p>Obviously, as a man, I am not going to be subject to the kind of discrimination a woman would be, so if someone&#x27;s views annoy me and I dismiss them, that&#x27;s much different than when discrimination against a woman affects her livelihood and state of mind. In this regard we have to consider women as a particularly vulnerable population (in this industry, anyway) and act to protect them from the disproportionate negative effects of bias in the industry.<p>On top of that, the lack of women in the industry makes it very difficult to have a fair discussion of the issues. We should be trying to help men understand why women need special treatment, in order to help the industry grow out of its biases. But you can&#x27;t help the industry get better if you fire anyone who questions the process. It&#x27;s the white-collar equivalent of shooting anyone who doesn&#x27;t tow the party line. This prevents establishing a dialogue, enforcing culture through fear. And a culture built on fear is never a good thing. It&#x27;ll end up setting back the whole endeavor.",

    "text": "&gt; From my admittedly distant viewpoint (I&#x27;m not from your country), the GOP has changed substantially in recent years. It used to be a responsible political party that respected democracy. Then it seemed to start believing the ends justify the means - redrawing voting districts, filibustering, etc.<p>There&#x27;s something missing in your perspective which is that redrawing voting districts, filibustering, etc are political strategies that have been used by every party in the USA since the late 1700s. Gerrymandering was named after one of the signers of the constitution. The Democratic Party had a solid control of congress for several decades in the 1900s due to gerrymandering (voting districts redrawing). The filibuster was used by democrats as well and as the senate passed back and forth between GOP and Democratic control, each side used it more than the last time.<p>Now, a lot of noise has been made in recent years in the media about these tactics because the GOP happened to be in a position in 2000 and 2010 to gerrymander the districts themselves, but it&#x27;s nothing new.<p>I guess regarding the birth certificate thing, credulity for conspiracies is nothing new among the GOP party base. In the 1990s they were convinced that Bill Clinton had dozens of people murdered to cover up his crimes (&quot;Clinton body count&quot;).",

I wish for his sake that he hadn&#x27;t gotten into the differences between front end &#x2F; back end code because it does sound particularly speculative and presumptuous - but if you can take a step back and take a broader look at his arguments there does seem to be some scientific evidence in support of his main thesis that &quot;that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership&quot;.<p>Note: I just wanted to point out that I am appreciative that you are attacking his memo on the merits of his arguments. I apologize if that comes across as a patronizing thing to say, but for me the big scandal here has really been the way that dissenters have warped, twisted, and outright dismissed his memo as wrong without even attempting to counter any of his points. To me it feels like the liberal left (of which I self identify, btw) are dismissing his argument not because it is wrong, but because it contradicts their beliefs or because they are afraid of where a serious exploration of the subject might lead us. I don&#x27;t personally have any issues with affirmative action (although I can understand how it might upset some people) - but I do care greatly about protecting the free and open exchange of ideas. And the calls for the this guy to be fired feel like a disturbing form of censorship to me.",

    "text": "Quotes from link:<p>&gt; But it is not clear to me how such sex differences are relevant to the Google workplace. And even if sex differences in negative emotionality were relevant to occupational performance (e.g., not being able to handle stressful assignments), the size of these negative emotion sex differences is not very large (typically, ranging between “small” to “moderate” in statistical effect size terminology; accounting for less than 10% of the variance). So, using someone’s biological sex to essentialize an entire group of people’s personality would be like operating with an axe. Not precise enough to do much good, probably will cause a lot of harm.<p>&gt; Again, though, most of these sex differences are moderate in size and in my view are unlikely to be all that relevant to the Google workplace (accounting for, perhaps, a few percentage points of the variability between men’s and women’s performances). Sex differences in occupational interests, personal values, and certain cognitive abilities are a bit larger in size (see here), but most psychological sex differences are only small to moderate in size, and rather than grouping men and women into dichotomous groups, I think sex and sex differences are best thought of scientifically as multidimensional dials, anyway.<p>&gt; Within the field of neuroscience, sex differences between women and men—when it comes to brain structure and function and associated differences in personality and occupational preferences—are understood to be true, because the evidence for them (thousands of studies) is strong. This is not information that’s considered controversial or up for debate; if you tried to argue otherwise, or for purely social influences, you’d be laughed at.<p>&gt; Sex researchers recognize that these differences are not inherently supportive of sexism or stratifying opportunities based on sex.<p>The problem in the employee&#x27;s memo seems to be correlating scientific data (which is accurate) to groups of people (women) at Google and their qualifications (inaccurate).",

I found it to be a well thought out document, asking for greater tolerance for differences in opinion, and treating people as individuals instead of based on group membership.<p>&gt; Within the field of neuroscience, sex differences between women and men—when it comes to brain structure and function and associated differences in personality and occupational preferences—are understood to be true, because the evidence for them (thousands of studies) is strong. This is not information that’s considered controversial or up for debate; if you tried to argue otherwise, or for purely social influences, you’d be laughed at.<p>&gt; Sex researchers recognize that these differences are not inherently supportive of sexism or stratifying opportunities based on sex. It is only because a group of individuals have chosen to interpret them that way, and to subsequently deny the science around them, that we have to have this conversation at a public level.",

Of course his theorizing is not a fact, therefore he wants discussion, additional data, and openess of some of these diversity processes.<p>&quot;As society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, innate dispositional differences between men and women have more space to develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their personality traits becomes wider.&quot;<p>The above happens in Norway and Sweden where women hate STEM even more. Yet, I believe, both have schools not using any gender role bias for decades.<p>Unconscious bias training that Google uses is in worst case brain washing, best case does not work at all.

I&#x27;m of the opinion that females just don&#x27;t want to do software development and that decision is made really young.<p>I think the change we need to make is less about the profession and more about the people in the profession.  We need to make it a field that seems open to women.  Currently it isn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t have a daughter, but I&#x27;d be very hesitant to suggest to her to go into the SW field.<p>BTW, my sister tinkered with PCs as a kid.  It is interesting that she went on to get a degree in statistics and me in computer science.  She works in policy now, and me in CS -- despite the fact that both of us had very similar achievement paths through HS.  To this day she is better at most maths than I am, but most people seem to assume I&#x27;m better (at least when it comes up).",

When girl wants to become ballerinas it is presumably because they have some idea that it is glamorous, not that it entails working hard under strict discipline for many years. They figure that out later.<p>What happened in the 80s was likely because computers went from being for business to being a hobby with the home computer [0]. I would imagine that because men dominated technical professions at the time most computers were bought by men, which then shared their interests with their sons [1]. Programmers like John Carmack and Linus Torvalds is born around 1970 and would be teenagers when home computers became available [2]. Games went from adventure quests and puzzles to shooters like quake and duke nukem. Social settings like mailing lists became more important to learn programming through open source. So the cycle continues.<p>Of course just like girl, boys probably didn&#x27;t know what the profession actually meant. They wanted to be programmers because of things like video games, but ended up making business systems.<p>How do you fix it? Many CS programs are antiquated and changing the curriculum to software engineering doesn&#x27;t seem to help much to attract a broader group of people.

It&#x27;s a good process that leads to quality hires, but it&#x27;s also a very slow one because not everyone can take a few weeks out of their life for a job trial, if they&#x27;re currently employed.<p>The diversity program is an invitation for women, minorities, and disabled people to do an internship. The goal of the internship is to learn, not necessarily to demonstrate ability to do the job. It is paid. It lasts 4-6 months. Interns are invited to go through the normal hiring process afterwards, with the benefit of some experience on the job. There are no full time jobs reserved for any particular type of person. If they choose not to stay with the company, they still get a genuinely useful resume item out of it, moreso than they&#x27;d get from a 2 week trial. It can also be used for school credit. Some people might come back and apply again after they finish school.<p>Around a hundred people go through the normal trial process each year, and it&#x27;s currently not enough. That&#x27;s why the diversity program was launched, just to get more people into the pipeline. Only about 8 interns go through the program each year, because so far it&#x27;s a small experiment, but it&#x27;s working out so far. A few interns have been hired full time, and a couple of people who couldn&#x27;t hack it got to at least have a taste of what it&#x27;s like.",

I have no such age discrimination problem in the UK, loads of jobs here but not any where as well paid as the US. I might point out that you had 20 years to make a ton of bank. If you want to fix age discrimination, campaign for it, but leave it out of this thread.<p>As for companies being boys clubs, to me that&#x27;s clearly unacceptable, it&#x27;s simply wrong to say that a &quot;company culture&quot; can be male only as that&#x27;s clear discrimination.<p>If you think that discrimination&#x27;s ok, it feels as if you want to take it out on women because you want to go back to living in a man-cave, replete with pizzas and then a late night coding sessions followed by a game of Quake, where women don&#x27;t fit because they spurned us at high school. And if they want to join in, they better start their own company.<p>Do that with your mates, that view doesn&#x27;t belong in a company, shouldn&#x27;t belong in a company. It&#x27;s not a male-only social club.<p>But if you agree that&#x27;s wrong, you and I caused this problem, and we&#x27;re the ones who have to fix it, have the <i>opportunity</i> to fix it. Perhaps our Dads and Grandads told us computers are for men only, but they aren&#x27;t and we don&#x27;t have to wait until your kids are growing up to fix this. We can fix this now, and positive discrimination is a way that works.<p>Tech is growing up and we need to fix the gender imbalance <i>we</i> helped cause.",

It seems that the Jewish people have collectively been more resilient to persecution and therefore need no assistance, but so what? Good for them, but it doesn&#x27;t diminish the fact that other minority groups still wear old wounds that hurt them today. Are you seriously suggesting that we shouldn&#x27;t help disadvantaged black Americans simply because disadvantaged Jewish Americans didn&#x27;t need it?<p>* Millions of white people across the Midwest are in bad shape, you&#x27;re right about that. I support programs and practices that will help them out. I also support programs and practices that support other disadvantaged race and gender groups. So I don&#x27;t know what to make of the question &quot;what about them?&quot;. I&#x27;d have to hand the question back to you: what about them?<p>* The government is definitely necessary to address much of this, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to ignore the role of corporations as the backbone of our capitalist society.

Not to mention that some corporate diversity initiatives are actually attempts to comply with government policy.

There are plenty of things I am not open-minded about:<p>The examples you cite are obviously extreme, and so you obviously put me in a bit of an unfair position in having to defend them, so I will start out by unequivocally stating that I do not hold this belief, nor do I advocate it or believe it in any way.<p>With that out of the way, saying you would <i>never</i> countenance holocaust denial is in many ways equivalent to the Catholic church saying it would never countenance a heliocentric universe. The science up to that point was on their side. The &#x27;known&#x27; facts and their religious scholarship were on their side. But they were wrong. Similarly, you know the holocaust happened because you&#x27;ve read it happened. You weren&#x27;t there. You likely don&#x27;t know anyone who was there, or if you do, their memories are quite old, and modern science knows quite a bit about how fickle memory can be. It is <i>possible</i> the the holocaust did not happen. Unlikely in the extreme, but possible.<p>Now, am I going to waste my time listening to a holocaust deniers argument? No, probably not. I put an extremely low prior on the holocaust being ahistorical. So low that it&#x27;s unworthy of even the most passing consideration. However, that prior is not zero, and it should <i>never</i> be zero. If I started hearing enough people that I respect saying, &quot;hey, you should really listen to this holocaust denier&#x27;s argument, it&#x27;s kind of interesting&quot;, I might start to pay attention.<p>My point in defending a non-zero prior for <i>all</i> beliefs is simply to illustrate that you have some prior belief about what this Google engineer has said. You either have or have not read what he actually wrote. I think it likely you haven&#x27;t. Because what he actually says is fairly reasonable. Certainly not in the &#x27;holocaust denial&#x27; realm  of truth-probability.<p>If you have the time and inclination to post here about it, then you have the time and inclination to reject his arguments directly, rather than simply dismissing them out of hand. What is the point of that sort of dismissal? It convinces no one. It changes no opinions. It adds nothing to the universe. This guy made a rational, intelligent argument in support of his case. He cited studies, he explicitly embraced the ideals of diversity, but simply disagreed with a few of the methods. If you disagree, that&#x27;s fine. But have the courage to do so substantively. Maybe you&#x27;ll change some people&#x27;s minds, and actually further the cause you seem to be arguing for.",

    "text": "This assumes that talent and hiring is considered as a thresholded binary model, where you are either &quot;good enough&quot; or &quot;not good enough&quot; to work for the company, and the difference between two people who are &quot;good enough&quot; isn&#x27;t important.<p>Of course, because of cultural and historical prejudices and biases, the pool of candidates that even apply to google is biased towards white males. Everything possible should be done to attract applications or seek out potential candidates from minority populations. But without suggesting any biological differences, it is still likely that because of cultural and historical prejudice, the distribution of talent among candidates will be skewed toward white males. Again, not because of any biological difference, but because they are more likely to have been encouraged or gone to rich universities or had parents who were engineers.<p>If we have a pool of 100 people and we want to hire the best five, then the bar is set by ranking the people by talent and qualification. If we want to hire everyone who is qualified, then wherever we set the bar, it is still likely that the population above the bar is skewed. So if we want to achieve a rebalancing or quota of employees from a certain sub-population, then it certainly does involve lowering the bar. We can argue over whether that is a good thing to want, or a fair thing, but I don&#x27;t think you can logically argue that the bar isn&#x27;t being lowered if you want to achieve a quota for a certain subpopulation. If you are suggesting that the population above the bar is not skewed, then you are suggesting that the terrible cultural stereotypes, biases and prejudices against women and minorities in technical fields has had no effect on their ability to achieve talent and qualification above the level of the bar, which I find implausible.",

    "text": "Here&#x27;s my understanding of Google&#x27;s hiring practice. In essence, Google optimizes to minimize false positive (i.e. hiring unqualified engineers). Hence, even if an applicant meets the bar (i.e. qualified), it is still a crapshoot whether the person is hired or not. By lowering the false negative rate (i.e. rejecting qualified applicant), the effective hiring rate for the target demographic group is higher if all other factors are assumed to be constant (and that&#x27;s a big if and debatable).<p>Edit: \nAnother way to say this is, if an applicant simply meets the bar, the person is most likely not hired. Conversely, an applicant needs to far exceed the bar in order for interviewers to vouch for the person and improve odd of hiring.<p>On the other hand, applicant that fits into the targeted demographics are probably afforded additional consideration, even if the person&#x27;s interview did not wow the interviewers as much, hence the &quot;lowering the bar&quot; argument. It is not lowering the standard bar, but rather the &quot;score&quot;, if you will, the applicant needs to clear the bar.<p>The best analogy I&#x27;ve read so far is that the candidate&#x27;s score and its error bar must clear the bar. But affirmative action applicants are extended the courtesy of second look, which reduces the error bar, hence lower score is needed for the score and error bar to clear the Google bar.",

    "text": "I&#x27;m not in this guy&#x27;s head but, it&#x27;s not difficult to come up with a charitable interpretation from his perspective. Let me be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that this is what I believe. I&#x27;m saying that based on the rest of his writing, this _one potential_ lense through which he may have constructed this sentence.<p>&gt; Hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar for “diversity” candidates by decreasing the false negative rate<p>&gt; decreasing the false negative rate<p>(Again! This is from his POV): The false positive rate has not gone up. The diverse candidates are, in fact, qualified and should have their jobs. They are excellent. I am going out of my way to make sure no one interprets this deluge of text as me questioning my peers ability; something that I will fail at in spectacular fashion.<p>&gt; lower the bar<p>(His POV don&#x27;t pin this on me): However, diverse candidates may now have a lower bar than non-diverse candidates.<p>How is it possible that some candidates have both a &quot;lower bar&quot; and yet are still qualified?<p>&gt; Hiring practices<p>(still his POV folks): Because for diverse candidates we have different hiring practices. Practices which are tailored to diverse candidates. It&#x27;s not a lower bar, it&#x27;s a different bar. A bar specifically designed to help us discover the best side of these diverse candidates.<p>(Speaking for myself now):\nI think the author is saying that going out of your way to create specific affordances for _some_ and not for _all_ is discriminatory. I _don&#x27;t_ think he&#x27;s a horrible monster for thinking this. I _do_ think that this way of thinking fails to acknowledge the fact that an organization that is already steeped to the brim with a specific group of people is likely to _already_ have built in affordance for that group.<p>He fucked up. Hard. Like so hard that I find it kind of funny (wtf was he thinking?). I, personally, don&#x27;t think that the ideas that he espoused merit firing, I think they merit careful correction wherein the person doing the correcting attempts to read his meaning charitably, carefully, truthfully and fully. I feel that most of the public responses have failed in this regard. Most of what I&#x27;ve seen start with &quot;he&#x27;s basically wrote: {$straw_man}&quot;. Some are pandering to an audience, some are more interested in winning than in being right, but some people who retort in this way just have limited time and patience. I can understand why the straw man is appealing. I&#x27;ve just written three paragraphs about a single sentence, who has time for this shit?<p>Here&#x27;s the thing though, careful correction, truth, charity—that&#x27;s my &quot;ideal world&quot; case for him. The simple matter of fact is that Google is not the ideal world, they have no incentive to apply my ideal to him. He&#x27;s a professional and the fuck up alone (separated form the ideas) represents enough potential harm to Google that he had no hope of keeping his job. Maybe one of his friends can give him the careful walk through of how his ideas are flawed. Hell, maybe a good friend will do that and he&#x27;ll decide that he was right all along.<p>Edit: After further reading I realized I had made a mistake when I (speaking from his POV) said: &quot;it&#x27;s not a lower bar, it&#x27;s a different bar&quot;. He did actually use the words &quot;lower the bar&quot;, something I failed to fully account for. One could, with liberal amounts of charity, imagine that he meant that the bar was lower but still sufficient? We&#x27;re getting into logical acrobatics. That said, logical acrobatics are part of the point. The goal in reading someone whose world view is different to your own is to better understand their logic. To imagine how, within their world view, their ideas are consistent. We could be reading the words of a monster who doesn&#x27;t care about logic. Or we could, and I think this is much more common, be reading the words of someone with flaws and ignorances and prejudices. Someone not so unlike ourselves.",

But the key conclusions that he draws from those studies (and really, the entire point of the memo) don&#x27;t have any direct scientific support that I know of.  Perhaps I am missing some key references.  Care to provide citations for some of these?<p>&quot;Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things ... These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a citation for the first part.  What&#x27;s the evidence for the conclusion drawn?<p>&quot;Neuroticism ... This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.&quot;<p>Citation for why neuroticism leads to fewer women in high stress jobs?<p>How about the entire &quot;Non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap&quot; section?  That contains stuff like this:<p>&quot;Women on average show a higher interest in people and men in things&quot;<p>&quot;Women on average are more cooperative&quot;<p>&quot;Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average&quot;<p>Each of these statements (which at least hit my radar of being scientifically supported from the literature I know) is followed by some suggestions on how to improve the workplace for women.  Implicit, of course, is that these aggregate scientific differences are somehow responsible for the gender gaps in tech.  Any citations for why the quoted statements explain anything at all about gender differences in tech, rather than say, other STEM fields (biology?  medicine?  they have very different gender gaps).<p>It would be great to have the references I&#x27;m missing, because without them it sure appears the author is citing well accepted studies in order to make it look like his unsupported conclusions have &quot;evidence&quot;.",

I have personally always tried my best to remove any specific hurdles my minority colleagues might encounter, and I will support anything that helps in this respect. But no more than that : make people welcome, but stop short of forcing them in or blaming the system if they don&#x27;t come. This is where some diversity programs go IMHO too far by trying to fix what ain&#x27;t broken, if their aim is social justice (the best defence for them is actually a business argument : greater diversity does make for better functioning teams, so it might be worth artificially forcing it)<p>The dogma that needs to be questioned (not least because the scientific evidence against it is overwhelming) is the idea that the gender imbalance in STEM fields (and in nursing&#x2F;care&#x2F;humanities) is more likely the undesirable outcome of sexism, discrimination and hostile environments, rather than the desirable result of free choices made by liberated western women following their hearts.\nObviously, if it turns out to be the latter, it follows that the whole fight for parity at all costs (the &quot;magical speculated number&quot; of 0.5) looks like a rather moot and quixotic endeavour. How about just letting people be whatever they want to be ?<p>Occam&#x27;s razor is again helpful here : on one side we have a very straightforward biology&#x2F;hormonal influence-based theory supported by evidence. On the other hand we have something much more complex, bordering on conspiracy theory : &quot;the patriarchy&quot;.

His point was if we have equality of opportunity, meaning that interviews&#x2F;applications are completely blind (this is impossible to do 100% in practice) and &quot;fair&quot;, what would we expect the application and hire rate of men vs women to be? Is it 50&#x2F;50? Or might it be different distributions for different jobs depending <i>partially</i> on biological predisposition to certain interests? If there are less women and more men interested in that type of role, then that could be partially due to biological predisposition to wanting that type of job.<p>This is not at all to say that, as the person in charge of hiring, you should be concerned about these things. You should set objective standards for what you need in a particular role and hire the individuals that best meet those standards.<p>That being said, there is ample evidence that most of the disparity in tech in hiring is due to cultural&#x2F;social factors and focusing on biological aspects is mostly a waste of time. I think a lot of the diversity-increasing efforts in place at companies such as Google are commendable and should be continued.",

A person should be hired based on their skills&#x2F;qualifications and potential ability to do the role (based on the experience&#x2F;interview) and that should be the main and overriding criteria.<p>Of course, you can have hypothetical scenarios e.g. you have two candidates who are equally qualified and practically match neck to neck and you can only hire one and you have a lack of diversity in your company, sure, you can hire the person who brings more diversity.<p>However, if you have, say, white male person who is more qualified than, say a non-white female person, and those are your top two picks, then you should choose the former because it is about being most qualified for the role. If the non-white female is most qualified, than she should be chosen. I&#x27;m simply advocating meritocracy.<p>You mentioned that &quot;The diversity program came about because they are actually struggling to find enough qualified candidates&quot; and &quot;he company was majority white and male, and they didn&#x27;t have enough people, so they decided to tap into the vast universe of people who aren&#x27;t white or male&quot;. I don&#x27;t understand the first part - were they excluding non-white&#x2F;non-male people from applying initially? Isn&#x27;t that unlawful?

So I would submit that no, an employer shouldn&#x27;t have to compensate for a pool bias because they have no impact on it but in turn it can only lead to lower long term outcomes for them.<p>Personally I suspect that there&#x27;s a mix of both cultural (girls play with dolls traditionally) and biological (boys tend to be more attracted to tinkering and building from even before they learn to speak) reasons for the ratio in people studying IT-related fields but I just don&#x27;t see how making hiring practices biased in any direction will help with that.",

Assuming I didn&#x27;t misunderstand your comment, that&#x27;s not really how it works. Companies have these sorts of diversity initiatives not because they think women are less capable, but because it has been shown that women in tech often experience toxic or otherwise negative conditions in the workplace in relation to their gender. These programs are a way for companies to try to course-correct. I don&#x27;t always agree with the methods, but I believe the overall initiative is a positive one.<p>I somewhat agree with the other comment here that &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t need a diversity program, sensitivity training, or unconscious bias training if you stopped hiring frat boys with no life experience straight out of college.&quot; I would just add to that that the issue isn&#x27;t just the frat boys hired straight out of college, but also some experienced devs who were allowed to simply remain in the frat boy mindset as they aged in the industry.",

    "text": "Firstly, you somehow did not even consider my whole point, which was that being a &quot;geek&quot;&#x2F;&quot;dork&quot;&#x2F;&quot;nerd&quot;&#x2F;whatever is not exactly something men are encouraged to be. And based on this I questioned to which extent men are actually (in the words of the original poster) &quot;steered&quot; towards tech.<p>Sure there may be some bias in early childhood between the sexes, but honestly, I have a somewhat hard time seeing this having a serious effect on someone&#x27;s career decision much later.<p>Firstly, this whole argument just seems like it could just as well be some urban legend. What possible proof is there that this actually has any effect? I&#x27;m not even sure how one would go about investigating this. I feel throwing around some argument which seem plausable (to some people) but in fact have basically no solid support and then treating it as if it were an established fact is, well, maybe not so good. It seems more like something the president would do. [1]<p>Secondly, and more importantly, there is a very significant number of both men and women who during high school will receive a fairly through introduction to the natural sciences and to me this would seem a much more significant than some trucks and dolls one played with when one were 5 years old. To provide a more precise counterargument, many boys wants to become firefighters or police officers, yet when they grow up, many abandons these career plans.<p>I admit I may be extremely naive, but the argument about people on TV has always struck me as somewhat odd. It seems to rest on the assumption that most people (well, at least women&#x2F;girls) in fact think men and women are different, otherwise, why would it matter what gender the people involved have?<p>Finally regarding the last point about career paths, well, the problem with all the examples is that there are jobs with similar pay where almost all employees are men, compare say kindergarten teacher with being a construction worker. Sure, I can admit that there is some pressure here and it being (significantly) easier for a man to become a construction worker and a woman becoming a kindergarten teacher. But if there was a wage gap between these two professions it is not as clear to me.<p>I would also like to point out that one can discuss things in different context, if these arguments were just made in general about how (some) women feel and how things have affected them and whatnot, that is one thing. But we are not just discussing things in general, instead there are some (at least to me) very serious accusations of of discrimination, and then we have as a society enacted and allowed a large scale discrimination of men in order to offset this. And now we have a man being fired for daring to even question these accusations that have been made against him.<p>[1]: If there is some solid support for this view I will happily admit I am wrong.",

    "text": "&gt; Are you seriously suggesting that we shouldn&#x27;t help disadvantaged black Americans simply because disadvantaged Jewish Americans didn&#x27;t need it?<p>Perhaps he&#x27;s suggesting that black, white, Jewish, etc aren&#x27;t the characteristics that we should be using to classify people as needing help. You&#x27;d probably have a lot less pushback if you created a biased hiring process that gave favoritism to people who had attended lower-income high schools or people who are the first generation in their families to earn a college degree. That hiring process would, overwhelmingly, benefit minorities since, as many are pointing out, they&#x27;ve been historically disadvantaged and systemic roadblocks like poor schools contribute to the difficulties we have with social mobility. It&#x27;s when you start using skin color or ethnic background as a discriminant that it starts to get uncomfortable for many people. I honestly find it kind of bizarre to say that I have more in common with my Russian coworkers, who grew up under communism and are also classified as white, than I do with the minorities who came to my birthday parties growing up.<p>Having grown up poor and now being fairly comfortable, it&#x27;s easy for me to see many of the disadvantages poor people face. I attended a public middle school that was less than 10% white. Despite being part of a single-parent family just barely above the poverty line, I had a mother with a PhD who took an interest in my education. Many of my classmates had parents that simply didn&#x27;t care. And I was lucky enough to test into a prep school and avoid the public high school. At that school, I saw the other side. Most of my classmates, both white and the few non-white, were rich and most had after-school tutors from the local university that would help them complete their homework. My mother worked long hours and I was largely on my own to tackle the very difficult workload (4-5 hours of homework each night). Of the few that I&#x27;ve stayed in touch with, I&#x27;ve seen former white classmates from middle school struggle. And I&#x27;ve seen the few minority classmates from my high school breeze through their schooling and find whatever jobs they&#x27;ve wanted. Their skin color didn&#x27;t seem to be much of an impediment when they had successful parents standing behind them.<p>So my opinion is going to be biased by my experience, but I don&#x27;t see skin color being the biggest factor when compared to socio-economic situation and parental education level. It&#x27;s not really controversial to say there&#x27;s a huge correlation between race&#x2F;ethnicity and being disadvantaged in those two areas, but for some reason it&#x27;s controversial to say that we should use areas like those instead of race&#x2F;ethnicity for these kinds of diversity programs.",

    "text": "You&#x27;re somewhat correct with your analysis. The bar stays the same, but on average those who get a more detailed analysis done will be closer to the bar than those who are subjected to coarser grained measures. So, it&#x27;s wrong to say it lowers the bar, but it&#x27;s right to say that it ends up giving you more people who are very close to the bar. Perhaps a better way to word it would be that Google&#x27;s diversity hiring method(of looping back around for a closer look on &quot;diverse&quot; candidates) <i>shrinks the error bars on the bar</i><p>Imagine it this way: You&#x27;re a fisher. The Law says that you can only catch fish which are &gt;= 12&quot; long. If you&#x27;re caught with &lt; 12&quot; fish, bad things happen, but otherwise you want to maximize the amount of fish you catch.<p>You have two ways of measuring length: a crude wooden stick with some fat lines on it which mark approximately 12&quot; - this is quick but only approximate. You also have a high precision caliper which can tell you the length down to .001&quot;, but it takes 2x as long to make the measurement.<p>You&#x27;re interested in catching lots of fish, so if any fish you catch are a little close to that line, you just throw them back with one measurement.<p>90% of the fish you catch are red, but about 10% of the times you catch a green fish, which are really sparkly and fun, so you change your standard: if the green fish on first measurement is really close to 12&quot;(not close enough to keep), instead of throwing it back like a red fish, you bust out the caliper and measure it more precisely, and throw out anything &lt; 12&quot;.<p>So, at the end of the day, assuming red and green fish are distributed equally across lengths in the ocean, what would the distribution of kept fish look like? Would the mean and median length of your green fish be higher or lower than the mean and median of your red fish?",

    "text": "This is an amazing discussion and it really needs to occur.  What scares me is how much this conversation is being ruled by an angry emotive mob, at the expense of democracy and free speech.  There is almost no fact in any of these comments.<p>Why MUST we have 50% of male and female in any industry?  Have you noticed how almost every media outlet ignores female dominated industries (such as veterinary science) [0], where over 85% of vets in the western world are female?  The strongest argument in this thread appears to be that there must be equal numbers for equality, but it&#x27;s only EVER applied to male dominated industries (Google it if you doubt me).  However, not only is this argument unjustified, it&#x27;s continually selectively applied by most mainstream media outlets, again and again.  There is no challenge or balance to any of these arguments from the mainstream media.<p>I am disappointed that Google sacked this engineer.  To understand this mindset, you really need to watch this video on Yale.  People being shut down from talking because they&#x27;re male or white [1] or because angry mobs don&#x27;t like what they have to say.  People in this thread talk about sexism and yet they struggle to provide any evidence (while I can point at truck loads of evidence of misandry, eg. domestic violence, veterinary science, etc).  This Yale video talks about this exact problem i&#x27;m describing.  We have a society where you are no longer allowed to express selective views (even with evidence).  Google have confirmed this with their dismissal of this engineer.  What we&#x27;ve become concerns me deeply.<p>To all of the people who have stood up for free speech (and you&#x27;re in the clear minority in this thread), I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  If you want to be able to sort out the media that&#x27;s worth listening to, watch reporting on this topic closely over the next few days.  Look for extreme prejudice and emotive language from the media.  To quote an excellent quote from the Yale video, &quot;these are moves of power, not reason&quot; (3 minutes in, [1]).<p>So where are the rational arguments?  What about the percentage of female university graduates with relevant skills?  What about Dr Simon Baran Cohen&#x27;s findings on very young children and trends to their thinking patterns?  Where are the facts?  Why are most people side-stepping facts?<p>Now please re-read this entire thread and ask yourself about freedom of speech.  Ask yourself about democracy.  Ask yourself about how many people have presented facts.  There is something seriously wrong.  You should be deeply concerned about the lack of debate, the lack of evidence, the number of emotive arguments and the message Google has sent to anyone who doesn&#x27;t toe the politically correct line.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;career-advice.careerone.com.au&#x2F;career-development&#x2F;professional-development&#x2F;girls-just-wanna-be-vets&#x2F;article.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;career-advice.careerone.com.au&#x2F;career-development&#x2F;pro...</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xK4MBzp5YwM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xK4MBzp5YwM</a>",

He was using scientifically demonstrated biological and psychological differences between men and women (women have &quot;higher agreeableness&quot;) to <i>hypothesize</i> about how that affects their work choices and, notably, their <i>performance</i> (&quot;This leads to women generally having a harder time ... speaking up, and leading.&quot;).<p>What this is doing is connecting a gender stereotype (which, sure, is scientifically supported in aggregate - that&#x27;s true for a lot of stereotypes!) to work practices and outcomes.  The authors claimed benefits of presuming that this connection is true are basically a) this will make conservatives feel more accepted at work, and b) diversity is &quot;bad for business&quot; (which is just provably wrong by an enormous amount of evidence that the author ignores).  I think a) is <i>absolutely</i> a worthy benefit, but there are lots of other ways to do this without linking gender stereotypes to work performance!<p>Now let&#x27;s look at the harms of having this &quot;debate&quot;, particularly <i>at work</i>, which are numerous and measurable.  While there are no studies demonstrating the link between biology and STEM job performance, there are many studies demonstrating the impact of widespread gender bias in STEM fields (classic recent reference: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;109&#x2F;41&#x2F;16474.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;109&#x2F;41&#x2F;16474.abstract</a>) and how it affects hiring and advancement.  The memo&#x27;s author correctly acknowledges these types of biases.  So the harm is perpetuating gender biases in the workplace that affects people&#x27;s careers.  Not to mention the harms of opening up Google to gender discrimination lawsuits (ala <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Price_Waterhouse_v._Hopkins\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Price_Waterhouse_v._Hopkins</a>), the productivity cost of employees who don&#x27;t want to work with people with publicly broadcasted unproven gender biases that could affect their decision making (&quot;hostile work environment&quot;), etc.  And not to mention losing the many economic benefits that a company reaps with a diverse, inclusive workplace.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth having this &quot;debate&quot;, especially at work, where the benefits are negligible at best, and the harms are clear.  If you want to have this debate, go write a medium article or something.  Don&#x27;t send this around your workplace.  It&#x27;s not that hard, really.  People call this thought policing, or groupthink or whatever, but it&#x27;s just harmful and a waste of time at work.",

    "text": "Women elect into different fields in large part because of social factors. If a company like Google decides that it doesn&#x27;t like those social factors, what&#x27;s wrong with that? Why should social convention rule?<p>A lot of clumping happens in fields. Tell me why women are better at symplectic geometry than symplectic topology (or not). Tell me why women are better combinatorists than number theorists -- I want to hear something about counting the tubers they gathered. Tell me why women are so much more suited to advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology than interventional cardiology (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aamc.org&#x2F;data&#x2F;448482&#x2F;b3table.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aamc.org&#x2F;data&#x2F;448482&#x2F;b3table.html</a>). I kinda love all the post hoc analysis that goes into explaining these differences, especially when you have to explain then why Portuguese and Italian women are great in algebraic geometry but French women aren&#x27;t (except for the notable exceptions like Claire Voisin).<p>Most people aren&#x27;t pioneers; most people follow the pioneers into situations in which they feel mildly more comfortable than the alternative. Sexism plays a huge role, while not being the only factor. Is it really surprising that if you put up a &quot;girls r dum&quot; sign on a clubhouse many will find somewhere else to go?<p>Women electing into different fields is pretty much tautological here. The question is why, and whether it&#x27;s for reasons we want to support and&#x2F;or perpetuate. The whole point of the memo at issue is that he figures it&#x27;s built into women biologically because computers aren&#x27;t cuddly and that it is thus justifiable and right to perpetuate or support the current set of social roles. I don&#x27;t know that the guy should have been fired, but it&#x27;s clear he&#x27;s not going to be a great team player or supervisor for women.",

The cartoon glorifies <i>harmful action</i> - and it&#x27;s a great representation of the far left now.<p>Progressives absolutely tolerate opinions and actions that harm others - they hold the opinions and commit the actions with great energy.",

Do you just assume you&#x27;ve somehow managed to eliminate all bias and the results must reflect the population? Or do you assume that you haven&#x27;t managed to 100% debug this highly difficult process?<p>It is very difficult to tell the difference between biased hiring and actual skew in the population. But when it&#x27;s a trait that has no obvious connection to the job, it seems best to assume the process is biased, unless really good evidence exists to demonstrate a connection.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say your interview process produces hires whose heights are substantially above average. If you&#x27;re hiring for a basketball team then this would make perfect sense. If you&#x27;re hiring Java programmers, it&#x27;s highly likely that your interview process is screwed up. It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that the population of good Java programmers is unusually tall because of some biological factor, but this idea needs some major justification before you use it to make decisions.<p>Obviously, the first thing to do is to examine your interview process and eliminate any source of height bias you can find. But what if you do that and you&#x27;re still hiring an abnormally large number of tall people? You could take this as sufficient evidence that tall people are better at this, but that&#x27;s putting an awful lot of confidence in your interview program. It&#x27;s more likely that you just haven&#x27;t found all the sources of tall bias. If that&#x27;s the case, then pushing for more short hires will <i>improve the overall quality of your hires</i> because you won&#x27;t be artificially excluding good short ones.",

Having gone through the interview process and received an offer recently, I&#x27;d certainly say it is.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d agree with the second part; one thing you can reasonably conclude is correlated with false negatives is diversity (there are studies that people form hire&#x2F;no-hire opinions within seconds of meeting a candidate, and studies that people have immediate biases when meeting people based on race&#x2F;gender; there&#x27;s also the simple fact that&#x27;s put to good use in <i>small</i> companies that hiring people like yourselves, although mostly in ideological bias etc., is a good means for team cohesion). I assume Google has done more research on this than I have. Handing out &quot;more tickets&quot; may just be a way to cancel out the fact that so-called diversity candidates are getting <i>worse</i> tickets.<p>However, even if they were simply giving out more tickets to diversity candidates, the average level of qualification of these candidates doesn&#x27;t change. You just have more of them. Maybe that&#x27;s a problem because you&#x27;re discriminating in their favor, but it <i>certainly</i> does not &quot;effectively lower the bar&quot; or impugn the qualifications of this over-represented group.

It entirely depends on the circumstances surrounding why he wrote the memo. If he did so entirely on his own without being asked or provoked, then you are right.

Countries like Norway are one of the most equality countries but they have the higher ratios, which doesn&#x27;t make sense because they have the less bias.<p>This sentence is a little garbled so not quite sure what you&#x27;re going for, but I like to point people to the example of the Danish parliament. A gender quota was established some decades ago to ensure that female members could get the job, because obviously half the population is female and so they need to be represented. Now that they have an equal number of men and women, they&#x27;re getting ready to remove the quota because it served its purpose, and it&#x27;s not needed anymore. There are enough qualified and experienced women with strong reputations available that they don&#x27;t need the help anymore.",

The study is flawed.<p>Are you saying the study is flawed because women got more hires in this context and that doesn&#x27;t reflect the larger aggregate trends?  You realize this study doesn&#x27;t reflect society as a whole, right?  It reflects the resume screening habits of a sample of people from a cross section of law firms.<p>Rather than dismissing a study because it doesn&#x27;t yield results that fit your worldview, how about you try understanding the context is was done in and reflecting on the culture where it happened?  Don&#x27;t give it a fleeting thought.  Really consider the many possible stories it could be telling you, but don&#x27;t settle on a favorite.  Hold the many possible stories in your head instead, ask questions and try different stories.<p>People have all sorts of biases.  I&#x27;ve known my share of bros who only hire pretty girls and other bros with common interests, taste and upbringing.  If they were being studied, their numbers would probably yield similar results.  Some of the bros I know would call in like-minded bros and then they&#x27;ll call in the women for an interview to see if they&#x27;re hot.  If they were part of a similar study, their screening habits would definitely skew the numbers toward this trend.  If it was up to me, I&#x27;d be counting how many of the pretty ones made into round two.  (Let&#x27;s just say they excel at recruiting and only hiring pretty girls.)<p>This is one <i>small</i> study that reflects an aggregate of biases of a <i>sample</i> of participants in <i>one</i> industry.  It does not reflect the world.  It doesn&#x27;t reflect their industry.  It doesn&#x27;t reflect one bias.  It is literally a snapshot in time of a sample of a cross section of society.  We don&#x27;t know how if those biases (there are many) were well-distributed or concentrated.  Repeating the experiment may even yield very different results.<p>All that doesn&#x27;t matter in the bigger picture, because for that slice of time &amp; sample, we have enough evidence to suggest gross discrimination for that sample and time.<p>It&#x27;s a reminder that the world is a complicated place and that there are all sorts of ways people discriminate against each other.  What it reinforces is that superficial discrimination happens for all sorts of complex reasons, rather than simply saying everyone is guilty of one form of discrimination.<p>&gt; One bias that I&#x27;m concerned about is that most gendered social experiments are hoping to find bias against females. It&#x27;s a big echo chamber as the manifesto guy would say.<p>Let&#x27;s not be obtuse about accepting or dismissing these studies.  People have a tendency to either overstate or discount their results when it serves their purpose.  I gave you a very small sample and merely suggested that discrimination happens in the world and that discrimination can be complex and nonlinear.  Take it with a grain of salt.",

That&#x27;s quite reasonable (if it&#x27;s actually true).

To do so, they&#x27;re necessarily sacrificing equality of opportunity and simultaneously making bad business decisions by not hiring their estimation of the best according to their interview process.<p>You&#x27;re right, hiring in tech has gender bias, but right now that bias leans in women&#x27;s favor at every step.  Other commenters have posted research on this point, but I&#x27;ll add my anonymous, unverifiable anecdotes to the pile.

There are hiring biases that are almost completely based on race, as demonstrated by one study on employee response to resume names:<p>&gt; In response to help-wanted ads in Chicago and Boston newspapers, they sent resumes with either African-American- or white-sounding names and then measured the number of callbacks each resume received for interviews. Thus, they experimentally manipulated perception of race via the name on the resume. Half of the applicants were assigned African-American names that are &quot;remarkably common&quot; in the black population, the other half white sounding names, such as Emily Walsh or Greg Baker.<p>&gt; The results indicate large racial differences in callback rates to a phone line with a voice mailbox attached and a message recorded by someone of the appropriate race and gender.

It&#x27;s probably also the first method that may come to mind for many people.<p>Also, if you spend 3x the resources to find 3x the number of candidates (is it linear? I dunno), conduct normal interview processes, and then randomly throw out 2&#x2F;3 of the male candidates that passed, while keeping all the women that passed, that is one way to triple the number of women you hire while having the same bar for men and women.  However, the step where you throw out a random 2&#x2F;3 of the male candidates might strike someone as highly irrational.  Why not throw out the <i>bottom</i> 2&#x2F;3 of male candidates?  But then you end up with male candidates that passed a higher bar.  You&#x27;re not <i>lowering</i> your standards for women, but you&#x27;re <i>raising</i> your standards for men, and then employees might notice and form the impression that the average male employee is better than the average female employee, which would be unfortunate.  But it would probably be difficult to convince the people involved that avoiding the &quot;unfortunate&quot; outcome is worth throwing away 2&#x2F;3 of the very best male candidates.<p>It might be possible to spend 3x the resources in such a way that all the new candidates you find are women.  <i>That</i> would be a way to avoid the above problems.  How would this be accomplished?  Perhaps you send a recruiter to a university, and have them only talk to the female students.  Hmm, that might be a little weird.  How about a female-only university?  That would be great.  Likewise any female-only programming meetup groups.  And of course any qualified female engineers that anyone knows—they&#x27;ll never be wanting for a job.<p>How well will a company perform that spends significant resources recruiting from female-only groups, compared to one that recruits from groups that simply take the best candidates?  How significant a fraction of company resources are normally spent on recruiting?  And I did see a study indicating that demographic diversity (measured as age and sex) improved morale.  I guess we&#x27;ll see.<p>What would <i>really</i> help is if universities published the CS accomplishments of all their female students, but not of their male students.  I wonder if they&#x27;d be willing to do it.<p>In any case, my original point was, even if a company does in fact implement its diversity program with one of the methods that does not systematically lead to higher-quality male hires than female hires, I think it is natural for someone to assume until proven otherwise that it <i>is</i> implemented by shifting the bar.",

    "text": "&gt; <i>But his memo had extensive sourcing, including many scientific studies. Are you saying that those studies are nonsense?</i><p>&quot;Extensive&quot; seems like a stretch. Here are the scientific (i.e., non-Wikipedia, non-media) citations:<p>- women are more interested in people than things (DOI 10.1111&#x2F;j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x)<p>- women score on average .4 sigma higher on &quot;neuroticism&quot; than men (DOI 10.1037&#x2F;0022-3514.94.1.168)<p>- the average woman is more interested in work-life balance than the average man (DOI 0.1080&#x2F;03069880600769118)<p>- moralizing issues is sometimes bad (DOI 10.1111&#x2F;1467-9280.00139)<p>- the concept of &quot;microaggressions&quot; lacks scientific backing (DOI 10.1177&#x2F;1745691616659391)<p>Of those, only the last one is directly relevant to his policy proposals. (And it seems to be one researcher&#x27;s position paper, anyway, but I&#x27;m happy to grant for the moment that it holds the weight of scientific consensus.)<p>The rest are all interesting scientific facts but the connection to his policy proposals is incredibly unclear. I said it&#x27;s based on personal feelings because the idea that software engineering involves caring about things more than people, that neuroticism (in the psychological sense) makes one less suited for software engineering, and that advancement in tech requires giving up work-life balance. As many others have argued (e.g., <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@yonatanzunger&#x2F;so-about-this-googlers-manifesto-1e3773ed1788\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@yonatanzunger&#x2F;so-about-this-googlers-man...</a> ), these are opinions of an extremely junior engineer who has confused &quot;software engineering&quot; with &quot;writing lines of code&quot;.<p>If we&#x27;re going to take the logic in this article seriously, we should much more readily take seriously &#x27;aphyr&#x27;s (absurdist) suggestion that men perform better on technical tasks in societies where they&#x27;re not allowed to own property: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;aphyr&#x2F;status&#x2F;894211417561341952\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;aphyr&#x2F;status&#x2F;894211417561341952</a> That one has a solid scientific citation <i>and</i> direct relevance to the policy proposal it&#x27;s making!<p>&gt; <i>This is opposite the blameless culture laid out as best practices by the leaders in tech</i><p>The blameless postmortem relies on the fact that you trust everyone to be making the best decisions they can under the circumstances and you trust them all to be well-informed and qualified, and that sometimes mistakes happen anyway and the identity of the person who makes it is basically chance. Take GitLab&#x27;s recent incident: if a company&#x27;s practices don&#x27;t involve testing backups, and someone is responding to an urgent production problem and deletes the wrong directory, it&#x27;s not a sign that the person who got paged is particularly incompetent. There is incompetence, but it&#x27;s a property of the entire team: backups should exist and be tested, runbooks should be clearer, production hosts should be more visible, etc.<p>But as a consequence, in order for the blameless postmortem to work, <i>you have to actually trust your engineers to be competent.</i> A person who writes a manifesto like this is also the sort of person who&#x27;s going to read a half-complete answer on StackOverflow that offers a simplistic but enticing explanation, and conclude that it is 100% relevant to their problem despite evidence to the contrary, questioning relevant internal docs along the way. Someone who does that isn&#x27;t someone you want responding to production incidents. You don&#x27;t want to blame them - because you don&#x27;t want to risk them causing problems in the first place.<p>Such a person is a mishire. The fact that certain people are rejected in the interview process (including false negatives!) does not violate the blameless culture. Once you conclude that someone was a false positive hire, you should promptly let them go with a generous severance.",

To ground this in the world of tech, reaching out to girls and underrepresented minorities does not mean turning away Asian &amp; white boys.<p>* Steering them towards STEM should leave the agency in their hands.

We are trained for this, and - surprise - none of the training says (or even suggest) &#x27;you should lower your standards for minority candidates.&#x27; In fact, none of the interviewing training even mentions gender or ethnicity.<p>I feel that this guy is coming from a disgruntled conservative-leaning position where he feels the company values don&#x27;t represent his. That&#x27;s a valid concern, but there&#x27;s plenty of companies out there. He should just leave and find one that has values matching his.<p>&gt; This was not the case at the company I worked for and it was a very negative thing<p>That&#x27;s sad. Hope you had better luck with the next one!<p>&gt; Sorry, forgot to mention that I&#x27;m a human in my post.<p>Sorry, didn&#x27;t meant to be offensive. I just <i>know</i> intrigue (which this memo tries to stir up) is the shortest path to a dysfunctional workplace.",

To me, that&#x27;s a pretty extraordinary claim and requires extraordinary proof. It&#x27;s true that there are some differences between the sexes. Women do a bit better on some mental tests than men and vice versa. But how much of that is biology and how much is upbringing? For instance, from an early age, studies show parents make girls say &quot;please&quot; more than they do for boys, and emphasize sharing. So do women fair better on some emotional tests because of some innate biology or because we&#x27;ve emphasized that kind of thing literally since they could talk? It&#x27;s really really hard to tease these things apart. And it&#x27;s so hard because those differences are tiny. If we assumed those differences really are 100% biological (again, a big assumption), it might explain why Computer Science would be 55% men, and 45% women. It wouldn&#x27;t explain the huge disparity we see today.<p>So if the reason women don&#x27;t show interest isn&#x27;t biological, what is it? A further complicating factor to the whole discussion is we&#x27;re talking about why women aren&#x27;t in computer science <i>now</i>. It hasn&#x27;t always been this way. Historically, the field of computing had lots of women. A lot of women went from &quot;human computers&quot; who did math by hand to programming the early mainframes (the movie Hidden Figures shows a time at NASA when this was happening). While a gender gap has always existed, it used to be a lot smaller. Women made up about 1&#x2F;3 of people with CS degrees in the late 70s and early 80s. But as the STEM gender gap has been closing everywhere else, it&#x27;s actually gotten wider in CS, and only CS. Why? The &quot;it&#x27;s biology and girl brains are different&quot; argument can&#x27;t account for that. Biology didn&#x27;t change.<p>What did change was society. Movies like Weird Science and War Games (my favorite) came out. The &quot;cool hacker&quot; entered Pop culture, and the stereotype they settled on was a boy. Girls were a lot less likely to have computers in the home as well. This is an interesting article (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;money&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;357629765&#x2F;when-women-stopped-coding\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;money&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;357629765&#x2F;when-...</a>) that talks about how early home computers were marketed as a toy to buy for boys.<p>It&#x27;s like we as a society decided that computers fell into the &quot;boy stuff&quot; category with GI Joe and baseball, not the &quot;girl stuff&quot; category like Barbie and softball.<p>I think it all adds up to a pretty convincing argument that biology has nothing (or very, very little) to do with it.",

    "text": "&gt; How can you tell the difference between your daughter being pushed by social convention towards gender normative activities, and your daughter&#x27;s possible innate preferences leading her towards those activities? Likewise, how do you know the tension is not between her peers and society trying to make her girl-like versus her innate preferences towards science, building, etc, and instead between your expectations for your daughter and her innate preferences. In other words, isn&#x27;t it as likely that your opinions are pushing her towards science as it is that society is pushing her towards girl-toys?<p>The categorical error you make, like the author of the anti-diversity memo, is conflating gender identity with a specific set of &quot;boy&quot; versus &quot;girl&quot; activities. Just because children have strong gender identity does not mean that you can categorize any given activity as &quot;girl-like&quot; versus &quot;boy-like.&quot; <i>I.e.</i> there is nothing to show that liking pink unicorns causes someone to have a preference against computer science.<p>As to our own daughter, <i>I</i> don&#x27;t want her to be an engineer or a scientist. I want her to be a lawyer, like her mom and myself. <i>I</i> also hated school and don&#x27;t place much emphasis on education. <i>She&#x27;s</i> the one who wants to do puzzles and math worksheets and build legos.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s anecdotal and doesn&#x27;t prove anything. The real evidence, to me, is that this association between math&#x2F;science and men differs dramatically between countries. In Bangladesh, more than 80% of teachers are men (overrepresented compared to the total labor force). And in India, half of science undergraduates are women: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catalyst.org&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;women-sciences\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catalyst.org&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;women-sciences</a>. It&#x27;s really a different societal mindset about what professions are appropriate for women versus men. For example, I grew up hearing my Bangladeshi mother complain about how the teachers in U.S. schools are women, when men make better teachers.",

If that understanding is correct and the goal is to increase the overall pool of qualified candidates, then why a diversity programme? Why not a general internship programme where the most bright of _inexperienced_ candidates are chosen irrespective of their color&#x2F;gender?

The alternative is freedom &amp; liberty (which benefits everybody). There are countermeasures to correct the &quot;bad actors&quot; &amp; reward the &quot;good actors&quot;. Many people who will choose to not give a certain company business if the company is perceived to be against one&#x27;s values.<p>&gt; This is specifically about why women leave engineering, with a number of incidental measures about the egalitarian qualifications across gender (for the studied population).<p>My responses to the &quot;Key Findings&quot; on the report:<p>&gt; Nearly half said they left because of working conditions, too much travel, lack of advancement or low salary.<p>I don&#x27;t have a study handy, but this is not a situation unique to women. Too much travel, lack of advancement and low salaries are a symptom of corporate culture &amp; the inverted leadership pyramid. Being on the bottom is not as good as being on the top &amp; there&#x27;s less room at the top. Having quotas does not help the people at the bottom nor does it necessarily create better cultural dynamics.<p>&gt; One-in-three women left because they did not like the workplace climate, their boss or the culture.<p>I didn&#x27;t like the workplace climates of several of my jobs. Didn&#x27;t like all of my bosses or all of the cultures as well. If there is harassment toward women in a workplace, it&#x27;s probably indicative of deeper issues where others are not being respected as well (in ways related to the characteristics of that person). The solution is not to put certain politically ordained &quot;victim&quot; characteristics on a pedestal; in fact it&#x27;s an anti-solution because it discourages organizations&#x2F;people to explore root causes.<p>&gt; One-in-four left to spend time with family.<p>Understandable as this has been a more traditional pattern for women. Having a child means focusing more on family &amp; less on the profession.<p>&gt; Those who left were not different from current engineers in their interests, confidence in their abilities, or the positive outcomes they expected from performing engineering related tasks.<p>The map is not the territory. Models are an imperfect distillation of reality; especially models aggregating the complexity of many different lives.<p>While I agree that there are different outcomes in gender, culture, race, etc. The point is everybody (as in all people) has the legal ability to succeed in a profession. If you want certain people to succeed more, address the tools that they have &amp; work to give them better tools so they can succeed. The wrong thing to do is to encourage a victim mentality &amp; a autocratic culture that enforces a certain predetermined outcome; that is the opposite of freedom &amp; liberty.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s pretty well established [0] that the circumstances of ones birth - race, wealth and, yes, gender are a key determining factor in your expected life outcomes. Equal opportunities are emphatically not available to all.<p>The source you provided assumes unwarranted prejudice as a reason. There are other determining factors related to the circumstances such as ability, temperament, education, culture, intelligence.<p>Let me clarify. Everybody has equal opportunity but not everybody is equally fit to take advantage of the opportunity. The best way to improve everybody&#x27;s situation is to make the participants more fit for the job.",

The scope of what constitutes an interference with freedom of expression is very wide. The European Convention on Human Rights, for example, refers to any “formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties” imposed on the exercise of the right. In many cases, it is fairly obvious that there has been an interference, for example where someone has been sanctioned for making a statement or prevented from establishing a media outlet. International courts take a wide view of this. For example, the UN Human Rights Committee held that removing a teacher from the classroom for racist statements made outside of the classroom, while keeping him employed on the same conditions, was an interference with his right to freedom of expression...</i>&quot;[0]<p>[0]<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law-democracy.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;10.03.Paper-on-Restrictions-on-FOE.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law-democracy.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;10.0...</a>",

    "text": "Thank you for clarifying.<p>Regarding the first point, about women being higher in neuroticism, the author does provide a source - wikipedia.  I understand there are different versions of the document, some of which omit sources or links.  The version I&#x27;m using as a reference [1] maintains a hyperlink to Wikipedia&#x27;s page on sex differences in psychology.  Wikipedia may not be the most reputable source, although I&#x27;ve always thought quite highly of it, but in this instance, Wikipedia, which does seem to support the author&#x27;s contention, has it&#x27;s source, an academic psychology paper.  The paper&#x27;s abstract [2] does also repeat the Google author&#x27;s claim, that women are higher in neuroticism.<p>As far as the Google author&#x27;s sourcing goes, I believe linking to a well sourced article on Wikipedia should be a sufficient citation for the document (which wasn&#x27;t intended as an academic paper but something more like an argument on a forum - per my understanding).<p>I don&#x27;t see how this claim, that women are higher in neuroticism, leads to what you alleged the author was claiming - that the biology of women hurts productivity at Google.  This seems to me like a possible explanation of why there are not as many women in leadership positions, and not an argument that the women who are in leadership positions have any defect.<p>By analogy, suppose I was asked why there were few Chinese basketball players, and I answered that height is useful in basketball, and Chinese people are shorter on average than white and black players.  This may be a suitable explanation for the observed phenomenon, or it may not be, but either way you should not interpret me as claiming that Yao Ming is a short person.<p>For your second point, this seems obviously true.  The &quot;false negative rate&quot; presumably refers to when candidates who would be good hires are rejected for some undesirable reason.  In other words, the test is generating an incorrect negative (your interview comes back &quot;Do not hire&quot; on a person who would make a good candidate).<p>This false negative rate effectively &quot;raises the bar&quot; to get hired at Google, albeit in an undesirable way.  The initiatives that the author links to in this section are presumably aimed at reducing the false negative rate for women, and thereby lowering the bar that women need to clear to get hired.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s a good thing to reduce your false negative rate.  You get more qualified employees and people who are qualified get a good job.  The discriminatory part of this, which the Google author is highlighting, is that Google wants to reduce the false negative rate FOR WOMEN and isn&#x27;t applying these same initiatives to hiring in general.<p>I agree that the author did not have enough regard for the social context of his post.  He seems to have believed Google&#x27;s lies that they cared about letting employees express themselves and share ideas to improve the company - when, of course, Google is a soulless corporation that will fire anyone with the temerity to criticize their sacred cows.  I think that says roughly that the employee was a bit naive.<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scribd.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;355823379&#x2F;Google-s-Ideological-Echo-Chamber#from_embed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scribd.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;355823379&#x2F;Google-s-Ideologic...</a><p>[2] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.apa.org&#x2F;buy&#x2F;2001-01642-012\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.apa.org&#x2F;buy&#x2F;2001-01642-012</a>",

It would be extraordinary if the sexes were exactly equal. There are very obvious and enormous differences between men and women in numerous areas. Why would we expect them to come out exactly equal?<p>But if you want stronger evidence, try this: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.cc&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.cc&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x</a><p>&gt;Results show that gender differences in Big Five personality traits are ‘small’ to ‘moderate,’ with the largest differences  occurring  for  agreeableness  and  neuroticism  (respective ds = 0.40  and  0.34;  women higher than men). In contrast, gender differences on the people–things dimension of interests are ‘very  large’ (d= 1.18),  with  women  more  people-oriented  and  less  thing-oriented  than  men. Gender differences in personality tend to be larger in gender-egalitarian societies than in gender-inegalitarian societies, a finding that contradicts social role theory but is consistent with evolutionary, attributional, and social comparison theories. In contrast, gender differences in interests appear to be consistent across cultures and over time, a finding that suggests possible biologic influences.<p>The point about differences in personality was brought up in the Google memo and perhaps explains your &quot;please&quot; thing. But look at the &quot;interest in people vs interest in things&quot; statistic. A d value of 1.18 is enormous. That means 93% of men are more &quot;thing oriented&quot; than the average women. And that&#x27;s assuming there is no noise in the measurement, likely the true value is even higher!<p>There&#x27;s also this later on in the document:<p>&gt;When Del Giudice computed the Mahalanobis D for gender differences in Big Five traits, based on a published data set, he found that although the mean d for gender differences in individual Big Five traits was 0.27 (conventionally considered to be ‘small’), the Mahalanobis D was in contrast 0.84, suggesting a relatively large mean separation of men and women in the multivariate ‘space’ of personality",

    "text": "Your two examples list physical differences, not mental ones. Forgetting the fact that your examples are both wrong (you don&#x27;t have to be tall to [play basketball][1], nor do you have to be biologically female to model bikinis), mental differences are markedly different from physical ones, because unlike a requirement such as &quot;you must be capable of lifting 200lbs&quot; which _may_ skew male, almost all humans are innately &amp; biologically capable of the critical thought required to program. The differences we see today comes from nurture, not nature.<p>There are no biological &quot;skills&quot; that men might possess innately that should make them a first-choice by default, nor is there any reason to ever pick a candidate over another because of some biological &quot;fact&quot;. At the end of the day, you judge a candidate by their output (performance, displayed intellect), not their input (nature OR nurture).<p>This is the whole point of Google&#x27;s unconscious bias training: humans create incorrect correlations between input (nature|nutrue) and output (perf, intellect) in the form of biases-- i.e., &quot;if you&#x27;re too emotional you can&#x27;t think as rationally as someone who is less emotional, therefore you cannot perform at the same level as a less emotional thinker&quot;. The problem here is that the correlation doesn&#x27;t hold; it&#x27;s a bias, not a fact.<p>Here&#x27;s the point: your &quot;biological facts&quot; are biases, evidenced by the fact that you think you need to be tall to play basketball or biologically female to be a bikini model, and neither of these things are actually true.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.complex.com&#x2F;sports&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;the-15-greatest-short-nba-players-of-all-time&#x2F;earl-boykins\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.complex.com&#x2F;sports&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;the-15-greatest-short-...</a>",

    "text": "This is an extremely different takeaway from mine. From what I read, the author repeatedly made it clear that he is not stating that women or racially underrepresented workers at Google are individually worse at their job. In fact, most of his discussion on different tendencies in gender are focused on selection of job field type of job within the field rather than ability. Furthermore, the author repeatedly reiterates that these tendencies are just that: tendencies, not rules. Some women pull 70+ hour work weeks. Some men work part time. To say that a larger portion of one group, even in the absence of cultural and societal pressure, is going to choose either the former or the latter is not disparagement.<p>To put this in a different context, take the gender discrepancy in murderers. Across nearly all countries, men commit roughly 75-85% of murders. This nearly uniform across agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial countries, rich and poor countries, liberal and conservative countries. I would consider it totally fine to say that men innately have a greater tendency to commit murder than women (and for what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;m a man myself). Is it okay to say that because I have a Y chromosome I should be treated as a murderer? Or that I should face a different standard of evidence if I&#x27;m on trial for murder? Of course not. But stating that I, as a man, am statistically more likely to commit murder than the average woman is <i>not</i> the same as saying I should be presumed to be a murderer and it is <i>not</i> the same as saying that I should face a different standard of evidence. But the point remains, it is okay to conclude that the discrepancy in murder rates is because of innate tendencies rather than discrimination by police, juries, etc.",

And yes, men who do become vets are statistical outliers, but certainly not &quot;freaks&quot;. It&#x27;s likely the same for tech and women - you are a statistical outlier, and from your perspective things are the norm, but the majority of women are not interested in the same things that you are interested in professionally. (The majority of men aren&#x27;t either, but there&#x27;s a larger minority of men sharing your professional interests than a minority of women).<p>And as for &quot;not getting somewhere original&quot; - the author&#x27;s point about the difference between comparing averages vs the overlap of bell curves around the averages is a great point and not one I&#x27;d seen highlighted that way before.

Privilege doesn&#x27;t stop just at men or women, white or non-white, there are numerous combinations of privilege that need to be taken into account.<p>&gt; where male privilege exceeds female privilege.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I can categorically agree with this. While male privilege exists over women, I find it ludicrous to suggest that white women are less privileged overall than black men, despite black men benefiting from male privilege. I think many of the misunderstandings that occur when discussing privilege come about due to using only a few easily categorized traits in defining privileges, rather than a broader set that also include things like socio-economic conditions, health, upbringing, and a variety of personality or physical traits.",

Even if you suppose women are more &quot;nurturing&quot; innately, that doesn&#x27;t explain any particular demographic distribution among, say, teachers.<p>Another example is the fact that 60% of accountants are women. Accounting is not only about &quot;things&quot; rather than people, but it&#x27;s often about completely abstract &quot;things&quot; (<i>e.g.</i> accrued tax credits). Women also are more &quot;agreeable.&quot; But within, for example, the legal profession, the cooperative practice of transactional law has a lower representation of women than the conflict-oriented area of litigation.<p>Within STEM: over 40% of math majors are women, but only about 20% of CS majors.

They publish the data, so you can see.<p>So evidently Google can demonstrate modest improvement. And it sure seems like the Guy Who Got Fired felt like he was seeing the undeserving and huddled masses approaching his ivory tower.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure exactly what you&#x27;d like. On the one hand, &quot;Someone needs to do something&quot; and on the other &quot;this blatantly favors one class of people.&quot; But I&#x27;m not entirely sure that last part is true. Google has quietly improved a lot of feminist hot-button issues that benefit men disproportionately in the last 3 years as well.<p>For example, Google increased its paternity leave policy. I know because one of the folks I met while interviewing there was ecstatic about it. They&#x27;ve also taken a lot of steps to improve life for families. I know because while interviewing I toured the day care facilities. Hell, Google quietly helps employee kids get into nearby schools and funds (and even runs) after school activities. You don&#x27;t even need a woman involved to trigger them, Google offers its -ternity leave to adopters as well.<p>These things disproportionately benefit men by the simple fact that there are many more men in the workforce at Google, so any family related benefits or policies (and these are important, real issues that deserve to be solved)  are really a massive win for men who want offspring.<p>So this whole angle about biases towards &quot;specific groups&quot; is really just a terrible prism. While I&#x27;m not saying this is your angle, it&#x27;s all too often used as a way to shut down any sort of concessions for minorities with unique challenges.<p>And the business value is really, really clear: a larger workforce means more supply and less demand. From a large business&#x27;s perspective, the 5 year operating costs of these programs is tiny compared to the savings a 5% reduction in minimum hiring costs would be.",

The point about OKRs contingent on hitting a certain percentage of diverse team members turning hiring and transfers into a zero sum game was actually a really good point that potentially hurts diverse groups themselves by limiting cross-team mobility.<p>* At the end, don&#x27;t try to turn this into a Conservative vs. Liberal issue.

    "text": "This is one of those situations where you have to exercise your logical reasoning skills. Why the hell would there be an innate gendered preference for a toy that represents something that&#x27;s existed for only about a hundred years? Indeed, a 2013 study shows that both girls and boys prefer dolls at 5 months: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencealert.com&#x2F;boys-prefer-dolls-to-trucks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencealert.com&#x2F;boys-prefer-dolls-to-trucks</a>.<p>And even if there was a gender difference in terms of preferring trucks to dolls, what would that really be measuring? Again, a five month old couldn&#x27;t possibly have an association between trucks and building things. You could just as easily be measuring the degree to which infants have an affinity for faces. You can&#x27;t get from that to a preference for&#x2F;against CS without a whole lot of handwaving. Which is ultimately the big problem. You&#x27;re pointing to biological differences and saying that must explain observed occupational differences, without providing any theory of causation. It&#x27;s an argument that doesn&#x27;t just have little explanatory power, what explanatory power it does have is based on gendered characterizations. (E.g. hypothesizing women prefer teaching because it&#x27;s a &quot;nurturing&quot; profession, while ignoring societies that don&#x27;t view it as a nurturing profession at all, where teaching is male dominated).<p>As to math preferences, you&#x27;re comparing tenure track professors, while I was referring to undergraduate degree holders (hence &quot;math majors&quot;).

Your observation is that he shouldn&#x27;t have said &quot;lowering the bar&quot; but it&#x27;s objectively true.<p>In this example, the bar for women is 90 + the likelihood of being nervous * 5. If you remove the second term for women and not men, you are lowering the bar for women.",

    "text": "&gt;a 2013 study shows that both girls and boys prefer dolls at 5 months<p>Might as well just measure what toys they prefer when they come out of the womb. No shit a five month old has no idea what a truck or a doll is. But by the age of four they will definitely prefer trucks as expected.<p>&gt;You&#x27;re pointing to biological differences and saying that must explain observed occupational differences, without providing any theory of causation.<p>I did provide a theory (things vs people), but it&#x27;s not really necessary. The original comment suggested that there were no personality or behavioral differences between men and women. This is a ridiculous claim. I have showed there are huge differences between the preferences of men and women.<p>Why would we expect two different groups with (statistically) different personalities and interests to make exactly the same career choices? I can&#x27;t necessarily predict which factors are the most relevant, or which traits correlate with which careers and how strongly. Those are specifics. But I would be completely <i>shocked</i> if the correlation between mental and personality traits and career choice is absolutely zero. And if they aren&#x27;t zero, that will necessarily imply a difference between the genders.<p>The alternative theory is that &quot;it&#x27;s all cultural&quot;. This theory <i>also</i> makes no specific predictions. No matter what outcome is observed, you can blame it on culture. You can invent a just-so story about how mathematicians are less sexist than programmers or something. It doesn&#x27;t require or present any evidence. It isn&#x27;t falsifiable. If one cultural factor is ruled out (e.g. discrimination), you can always make another and shove it in (e.g. &quot;role models&quot;.)<p>If you show evidence that one cultural explanation can&#x27;t possibly be correct, they just move onto another. E.g. showing that there are the same percentage of female tech workers as female computer science graduates. So they move onto blaming sexism in universities. So you show there are the same percentage of girls interested in computer science in high school. And then the theory moves onto blaming parents for discouraging girls from computers... or something. And I can&#x27;t think of any possible experiment that could test that and prove it false. So they say &quot;aha, gotcha! It was culture all along!&quot; as if they&#x27;ve proved something.<p>&gt;E.g. hypothesizing women prefer teaching because it&#x27;s a &quot;nurturing&quot; profession, while ignoring societies that don&#x27;t view it as a nurturing profession at all, where teaching is male dominated<p>The link I posted sort of addressed this. In less egalitarian cultures it&#x27;s possible differences are more cultural. E.g. Indians straight up discriminate against female teachers and don&#x27;t even make it an option. Or Indian parents forcing their girls to learn computer science because they see it as a way out of poverty. But as cultures become more egalitarian, gender differences will become more determined by biology. The west generally gives children a lot more freedom to choose their career and doesn&#x27;t discriminate by sex. So gender preference will become a lot more important in such a society.",

IMHO, the key part of being an adult is recognizing that your acts will have consequences, and be willing to face those consequences, positive or negative.<p>I also agree with that.
