# Forum Viewer

This chrome extension enables users to explore forum structured data (specifically hackernews) in a top down manner. This allows for easy understanding of the flow of conversations over time.

To run in development mode  

```sh
yarn

yarn start
```

In another terminal fire up a static server with live reload (i like live-server).
